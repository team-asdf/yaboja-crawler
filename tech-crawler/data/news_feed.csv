The Pixel Slate reality people seem to be missing," Reading coverage of Google's newly announced Pixel Slate — the two-in-one device that's both an Android-like tablet and Surface-like Chromebook — the clear and consistent theme you see is that Google just dramatically changed course with its computing vision.I've lost count of the number of tweets, analyses, and hands-on assessments I've come across expressing that sentiment — that the Pixel Slate represents a whole new beginning for Chrome OS in terms of both its Android-reminiscent interface and its positioning as a best-of-both-worlds tablet platform.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313346/chrome-os/google-pixel-slate.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-16T16:07:00

"3..., 2..., 1? How complaints tamed Microsoft's aggressive feature upgrade strategy"," Microsoft has jiggered and rejiggered Windows 10's release and support model enough times to befuddle even the most astute follower. Each time, the company downplayed what had been true and highlighted what had become the new truth. That's how things work. But it's left users without context.Here is a brief history of how Microsoft reacted to balking customers and changed the cadence of Windows 10.3... Before Microsoft got around to launching Windows 10, it was talking up the development and release cadence, promising that it would roll out a refreshed operating system at the unprecedented rate of three times a year.[ Related: Windows 10 October 2018 Update: Key enterprise features ] In an April 2015 Microsoft-hosted webinar, the company said the impending OS would receive upgrades - those that included new features and functionality - about every four months. Under that schedule, Windows 10 Home would first receive each feature upgrade; the same version would be served to Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Enterprise four months later.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313641/microsoft-windows/3-2-1-how-complaints-tamed-microsofts-aggressive-feature-upgrade-strategy.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-16T10:53:00

Stats make iOS a hard OS to ignore," The latest version of Apple's mobile operating system — iOS 12 — was released just a few weeks ago, and yet it's already installed on 53% of relatively newer iPhones (introduced since September 2014) and 50% of all iPhones. Bottom line: It's the fastest acceptance of any Apple OS.This is more than a minimally interesting statistic. It illustrates the key difference between Apple mobile devices and Android mobile devices: Although there are more Android users on the globe, Apple's users are much more of a community. That means many things from an Apple marketing perspective, but for IT, it means far greater security.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313104/apple-ios/stats-make-ios-a-hard-os-to-ignore.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-16T10:00:00

IDG Contributor Network: CEO Hans Vestberg is changing Verizon leadership to focus on 5G," It sounds like new Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg is making some serious leadership changes. I think this is exactly what he needs to do. The reason is his desire for Verizon to be a leader once again in the coming 5G wireless revolution. If they want to be a leader, not a follower going forward, then they need to make some serious changes. Good goal. Next question, will he be successful?Over the last decade, Verizon has been a mixed bag of successes and failures. Over that time, they have generally rewarded investors and had happy customers. They are the highest priced competitor, but their network is no better than AT&amp;T. They used to be a leader in the wireless and telecom space, but that was a long time ago.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313639/wireless-carriers/ceo-hans-vestberg-is-changing-verizon-leadership-to-focus-on-5g.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-15T18:31:00

A second bad driver — this one for audio — gets pushed out by Windows Update. Protect yourself!," Don’t know about you, but I’m well beyond fed up with all of the pushed Windows bugs. If you installed your Patch Tuesday patches last week like a good little lemming, Microsoft may have put you in an inescapable loop of blue screens, or turned off your audio.If either of those plagues hit you, there’s a complex series of manual steps you can take to work around the problem, combined with two new patches that may help if you can get your PC to boot. That’s assuming you haven’t already bought a new machine, or taken the busted one in for repair.First, the HP blue screens. I talked about the symptoms on Thursday: After installing the latest Win10 1803 or 1809 cumulative updates, HP machines sprouted WDF_VIOLATION blue screens. If you reboot, the BSOD comes back. Ends up that the BSODs weren’t caused by the cumulative updates — at least not directly — but were, in fact, caused by a bad keyboard driver update that was pushed out the Windows Update chute at the same time as the cumulative updates.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313322/microsoft-windows/a-second-bad-driver-this-one-for-audio-gets-pushed-out-by-windows-update-protect-yourself.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-15T12:58:00

IDG Contributor Network: Microsoft’s massive and important pivot to transparency," (Disclosure: Microsoft is a client of the author.) I’ve been following Microsoft almost since its inception largely because the firm recruited me early on, but I never even went to the interview, and viewed that potential career path as my biggest “road not traveled” alternative life scenario. But up through most of last decade, Microsoft was defined by a uniquely hostile employee environment particularly at executive levels and an antiquated proprietary lock-in strategy like the one that almost took IBM out in the early 1990s. That has changed massively under Satya Nadella who aggressively moved to both eliminate the crippling and nasty culture inside the firm and to make it a poster child for open source and rather than fighting competing platforms and approaches like Linux, embracing them.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313051/microsoft/microsoft-s-massive-and-important-pivot-to-transparency.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-12T18:30:00

Development Trend of Encrypted Traffic Deployment of more and more applications on the cloud and use of the Internet demand careful attention to cyber security threats. Attacks against web applications are the most frequent challenge.To ensure communication security and privacy, more and more websites use HTTPS rather than HTTP for transmission. HTTPS network connections protect information from snoopers, middlemen, and hackers who attempt to spoof trusted websites.That is, encryption prevents user information from being intercepted and ensures the integrity of information received and sent.Currently, the proportion of HTTPS traffic on networks is increasing and can even approach 100%, as shown in the following figures.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3313041/security/identifying-malicious-encrypted-traffic-using-random-forest-algorithm.html#tk.rss_all,computerworld,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-11T19:07:00

IDG Contributor Network: An easy October Patch Tuesday," Well, it was great to have a little break from posting on the Patch Tuesday Debugged blog. Since the kids are now back at school, it’s time to get back to understanding the impact of Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday update cycle on our desktop and server systems.For this October Patch Tuesday, we see a relatively light release from Microsoft with one zero-day vulnerability reported (CVE-2018-8453) and one publicly disclosed vulnerability CVE-2018-8423 included in the Microsoft monthly security update. We have already seen a few minor version updates to this October release, with 51 reported vulnerabilities addressed across Windows, both Microsoft browsers (IE11 and Edge), Office (Exchange Server) and the Chakra Core JavaScript engine. I expect that we will have a few more minor revisions to the Windows patches for documentation reasons this week. This does not imply a required delay, but your patch versions will change (update) over the next few days. You may also have noticed that Server 2019 (Microsoft’s latest version of the Windows server platform) was updated last week (October 2, 2018). You can find this update here.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos isn’t just focused on selling you everything you’ve ever wanted, or on winning another Emmy. He is also focused on sending people into space on what he called a “tourism mission.” Bezos, who also runs Blue Origin, a rocket company he has called the “most important thing I’m working on,” wants to launch the mission next year. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket has a capsule large enough to hold six “paying astronauts” — basically regular tourists with the ready cash for a round-trip ticket to space. Bezos didn’t mention how much it will cost, but he did say that Amazon will continue working with the Department of Defense, noting that if tech companies turn their backs, “this country is going to be in trouble.” [Kurt Wagner / Recode] [Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox?

Instacart’s new $7 billion valuation is a bet on the future of grocery delivery — not a wager against Amazon," The startup has a fresh $600 million in funding to boot. As Amazon has ramped up its Whole Foods grocery delivery service to 48 cities across the U.S., a common narrative has followed: The Seattle e-commerce giant will dominate in the grocery industry as it has done in other categories of online retail. But some investors continue to bet that there’s room for at least one other nationwide provider in the fast-growing grocery delivery sector: Instacart, which has raised a new $600 million round of funding that values the startup at $7.6 billion. The new financing and valuation — led by the hedge fund D1 Capital Partners — comes just six months after Instacart closed a $350 million investment that valued it at just $4.35 billion. Which raises the question: How does a privately held company increase its value on paper by 75 percent in only half a year? In Instacart’s case, it’s by being the chief ally to brick-and-mortar retailers in a $1 trillion industry where e-commerce sales are growing 29 percent year-over-year, but still account for no more than 5 percent of total sales. It also helps that Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods — and its subsequent rapid introduction of same-day delivery from many of its stores — has all grocers questioning their place in the world. Instacart’s place is as a partner to an increasing collection of 300 grocers — from Aldi and Costco to regional players like Wegmans — to deliver items from their stores to customer doors. “Grocery is the largest category within U.S. retail and it is also one of the least penetrated online,” is how D1 Capital’s Daniel Sundheim put it in a statement. “The industry is at a tipping point and there will likely be a significant acceleration in the adoption of online ordering for grocery delivery over the next few years.” Of course, the investors who have now poured $1.6 billion into Instacart over the last six years believe in the company. But they are betting as much on the idea that grocery delivery will become a mainstream shopping habit in North America that can support multiple players as anything — and not that Amazon will necessarily fail in the space. There are still obstacles that Instacart needs to overcome to build a truly mainstream service. Instacart charges customers both delivery fees and service fees that can make the service feel like a luxury, and around 30 percent of Instacart’s partner grocers also mark up prices on top of those fees. The company is still not profitable. Instacart has also had a notoriously tumultuous relationship with the network of 50,000 workers who pick out and deliver its groceries — something that its founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta recently vowed it was working hard to fix. As for how Instacart will deploy the new money, Mehta said the company planned to double the size of its product and engineering staff by the end of 2019, in part to create tools that make its service more efficient and its shoppers’ work easier. “We also want to make sure that Instacart is a household name,” Mehta said in an interview. “That when people think about grocery shopping online — that they think about Instacart first.” To that end, Instacart plans to make huge investments in marketing, including in many of its partners’ stores. Here’s my interview with Mehta at last month’s Code Commerce event in New York City.

Jeff Bezos wants to send tourists into space in 2019," “They’ll have a day or two of training,” he said. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos isn’t just focused on selling you everything you’ve ever wanted, or on winning another Emmy. Bezos, who also runs Blue Origin, a rocket company he called the “most important thing I’m working on,” is also focused on sending people into space on what he called a “tourism mission.” Bezos wants to launch this mission next year. “I’m hopeful that that will happen in 2019,” Bezos said Monday when he spoke at the Wired Summit in San Francisco. “I was hopeful it would happen in 2018. I keep telling the team it’s not a race. I want this to be the safest space vehicle in the history of space vehicles.” Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket has a capsule large enough to hold six “paying astronauts,” Bezos said, basically regular tourists with the ready cash for a round-trip ticket to space. (He didn’t say how much it will cost.) Bezos doesn’t even plan to have a Blue Origin employee in the capsule to supervise. “They’ll have a day or two of training,” Bezos added. “I’m pushing for a day. I don’t think you need two days of training for this.” It’s an ambitious goal. Rival rocket company SpaceX, run by billionaire Elon Musk, hopes to send a man to the moon by 2023. Blue Origin isn’t just focused on sending tourists to space. The company also has a new defense contract with the U.S. government to create rockets for satellite launches. “If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble,” Bezos said. “I know everybody is very conflicted about the current politics in this country. This country is a gem. It is amazing. It’s the best place in the world. It’s the place where people want to come. “There aren’t other countries where everybody’s trying to get in. I’d let ‘em in if it were up to me. I like ‘em. I want all of them.” Here’s video of a New Shepard rocket taking off and then landing again back on a launch pad.

Instagram’s Kevin Systrom on leaving Facebook: ‘No one ever leaves a job because everything’s awesome’," Systrom has no idea what he wants to do next, but he knows he won’t just be sitting on a beach. Everything wasn’t awesome at Facebook for former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom. That’s about all Systrom, who unexpectedly left Facebook last month amid tensions with Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, would say on Monday during his first public interview since departing. Systrom said that he and co-founder Mike Krieger felt that they’d gotten Instagram to a point of self-sufficiency and were eager to get out and build something new. When asked if there were tensions with Facebook, as Recode and others reported, Systrom didn’t push back on the claim. “Think about when you leave anything, there are obviously reasons for leaving,” he told Wired’s Lauren Goode during the Wired 25th Anniversary event in San Francisco. “No one ever leaves a job because everything’s awesome.” Systrom didn’t elaborate, but added that there are “no hard feelings at all” toward his former employer. Systrom, who is a new father, said that he recently spent some time reflecting with Krieger about the legacy they want to leave as entrepreneurs. The conclusion was that they were ready to do something else. “When I sat down with Mike and we started talking, we started talking about what legacy we wanted to leave,” Systrom said. “We were like, ‘What do we want to have accomplished? Is it a revenue thing? Is it a users thing?’ And it just all felt pretty hollow.” Systrom said he’s proud of Instagram’s work to try and combat bullying and harassment on the service, something that he hopes his successors will continue. (Instagram still has work to do.) “That’s the kind of legacy we wanted to have. Not selfies, hashtags. That stuff’s great, trust me, it helped us grow,” he said. “But what kind of mark you want to leave on the world has nothing to do with that stuff and has everything to do with social media and the internet more broadly.” Systrom says he hasn’t figured out what his next project is, but he and Krieger are planning to do something together. “I don’t have any plans yet, except to hang out for a little while,” he said. “I think I have a few more Instagrams time-wise in me. I’m not sure we’ll ever do anything nearly as impactful.” For now, Systrom is spending time with his daughter and learning to fly — he flew solo in an airplane for the first time last week. He’s also helping entrepreneurs that he’s invested in over the years, and reading and writing. Where you won’t find Systrom, who is worth $1.3 billion, is sitting on a beach for the rest of his life. “Listen, I had a beach week, don’t get me wrong,” he said. “Someone once told me the best thing you can possibly do between chapters is improve yourself. Learn. Get out there. Meet people. Be in different worlds. Figure out which of those worlds you really love.” ",https://www.recode.net/2018/10/15/17979680/instagram-kevin-systrom-facebook-departure-new-project,recode,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-15T18:39:45

Founded shortly after the Civil War, Sears pioneered the strategy of selling everything to everyone everywhere, but was gradually overtaken as a retail innovator, first by big-box chains like Walmart and Home Depot, and then by Amazon. Over the last five years, the company lost about $5.8 billion. The big question is whether a smaller Sears emerges from bankruptcy or whether the filing leads to a liquidation and a final end to the storied chain.

Amazon’s HQ2 announcement is imminent. Here’s a look at the final contenders.," Sort them by tech talent, rent and commute times. After more than a year of fanfare, competition and city government prostrations, Amazon’s announcement of its second headquarters location is imminent. Back in September 2017 the e-commerce company first asked for proposals from North American cities on where to house its HQ2, which would come with 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in capital spending for the winning city. Amazon said it was looking for a city equal to its Seattle headquarters and would preference those with lots of tech talent, good public transit and attractive tax exemptions. After receiving more than 200 proposals, Amazon culled those to 20 finalists in January. While Amazon has been mum about the winning city, plenty of people have placed their bets. NYU business professor Scott Galloway told a Code Commerce audience last month that the competition was a “ruse” and a game that was “over before it started.” He said that Amazon has planned all along to locate its second headquarters in the Washington, D.C., area, thanks to its proximity to CEO Jeff Bezos’s home and, more importantly, federal lawmakers. Ahead of the announcement, let’s take a look at the finalists and how they compare on a number of factors. CBRE’s tech talent rank takes into account 13 metrics important to tech companies, including an area’s concentration of computer science degrees, existing tech industry and cost of living. We also looked at average office rent and commute times to international airports.

Either would mean a win for the larger Washington, D.C., area. Columbus has the shortest airport commute time, Indianapolis has the cheapest high-quality office rent and tech wages would be cheapest in Toronto. The decision will likely hinge heavily on government incentives like tax breaks, which have mostly been kept secret. What we do know: Maryland offered $8.5 billion in incentives while New Jersey has proposed $7 billion in tax and other perks. Boston published its whole 218-page proposal for why Amazon should locate there. ",https://www.recode.net/2018/10/15/17914666/amazon-hq2-contenders,recode,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-15T11:15:01
Nobody trusts Facebook anymore. Here’s one way it could change that.," AnchorFree CEO David Gorodyansky says Facebook and other tech companies should make it easy for users to temporarily opt out of data collection. AnchorFree — the company behind the popular VPN app Hotspot Shield — recently surveyed its users, asking them when they cared about privacy and security. And when it came to most of their activity online, like sharing photos to Facebook, the survey respondents said they didn’t care. “But 30 percent of the time, almost everyone said they cared about their privacy enormously,” AnchorFree CEO David Gorodyansky said on the latest episode of Recode Decode. “That 30 percent was when it came to things like your healthcare, your finances and your family.” From a consumer perspective, however, the problem is that ISPs and data-hungry companies like Facebook don’t discriminate based on what the user wants. They’ll hoover up any data that they legally can, which is why apps like Gorodyansky’s are so popular; Hotspot Shield has been downloaded more than 650 million times, he said. However, he had a proposal for tech companies seeking to avoid government regulation: Turn off the vacuums for that 30 percent time in exchange for the valuable long-term trust of users who are turning against you. “I don’t think there’s anybody in the world today that trusts Facebook,” Gorodyansky said. “I think they use ’em, it’s a great product, your friends are there and you want to hang out with your friends. But I don’t think anyone trusts them. That’s the thing.” “If people are only concerned about protecting their data 30 percent of the time, it may not be a bad idea for these companies to say, ‘Look, let’s let people tell us when that 30 percent is and we won’t track them, for real,’” he explained. “‘And yes, our revenue will go down in the short term, but in the long term, our consumers are going to like us a lot more.’” You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with David. Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is David Gorodyansky, the CEO of AnchorFree, the maker of a virtual private network app called Hotspot Shield. It has 600 million users and Axios calls it “the most important mobile app you’ve never heard of.” We’ll talk about all of that and more. David, welcome to Recode Decode. David Gorodyansky: Thanks for having me. So, it’s a great time to be talking about security now, even though this is going to be airing later. There is a hearing tomorrow in the Senate about security and the lack of security on social networks. Obviously, everyone is concerned about the midterm elections and everything else. And most people are thinking really hard about how our technology is being misused, essentially, and hacked, and all kinds of different things. Not just hacked, but misused. So, just give us a little background on your company, AnchorFree. Sure. So, AnchorFree is one the companies that has been providing security and privacy for the masses over the last 10 years. We have about 650 million people that have installed our applications, across mobile devices and computers, and we grow by about 250,000 new downloads every day. Essentially, what we do for people is, our flagship app is called Hotspot Shield. It secures everything you do online, essentially making every app you use, every website you visit, as secure as your banking site or your banking app. We’re used on public Wi-Fi, which is a big area where consumers have their identities and data stolen a lot. So, airports, coffee shops, hotels, in-flight Wi-Fi. We encrypt all the traffic from a mobile device or computer or phone and essentially secure it all. The other thing we do is, we protect the users’ IP address, which is a unique number that your internet service provider assigns to you when you first connect to the web at home, or when you are connecting to Wi-Fi. And essentially we take that IP address, that unique number, and we throw it away. And so, it disrupts the ability of your internet service provider or random websites or hackers from tracking you across the web. And understanding what you’re doing. And understanding what you’re doing. They’re just seeing ... They’re trying to collect data into what you wanna buy, what are you looking at, what are you seeing, so they can just have that data. Like a Comcast or a Verizon, or a Google. Exactly. Well, until March of 2017, it was actually illegal for ISPs to collect and sell your data. Right. Until then. Yeah, as of March 2017, it’s now legal. They’re collecting and selling it without any problem. Just like the Googles and the Facebooks, right? Exactly. Exactly. And so, we’re protecting from that happening. So, talk a little bit about the background now. When ... How did you start it? So, my co-founder and I were both students when we started the company. We were 23 years old. And we were working out of coffee shops a lot and realized that Wi-Fi was unsafe and unsecure. We also realized that privacy as a whole was just gonna explode in the coming years, because billions of people are joining the internet on smartphones. As a matter of fact, today we have 2.5 billion smartphone users. Over the next three years, we’re gonna have five billion. People are moving on from old Nokia feature phones to smartphones. And with ... We realized early on that privacy and security were gonna be super important for people. And so we started AnchorFree. In our minds, what we really wanted to do was solve a real billion-person problem. We wanted to essentially take control over information, over people’s data, away from corporations like Google and Facebook, hackers and governments. And give it back to the people. And we felt like this would be something that really would be impactful at a huge scale, and essentially we started AnchorFree, launched Hotspot Shield. And most of our users, initially, were here in Silicon Valley using us. At Stanford, or wherever; on University Avenue, you need secure Wi-Fi. Until one morning we walked into our offices, and found a million Egyptians using our product. And we had no idea why. Uh huh. They were all in your office? They were ... none of them were in our office. I’m teasing. And we’ve never marketed in Egypt and we had no idea. We didn’t know anyone in Egypt. It turned out that the Arab Spring started, and Egypt blocked access to social media, and the only way people could get to information was through AnchorFree’s Hotspot Shield. We looked at that and we thought, well, this is super interesting. Privacy and internet freedom are some of the most pressing human rights, technology issues, and also like moral issues. You know, providing freedom and privacy are right, are the right things to do. And we’re very idealistic and naïve. We’re 23 years old and we’re like, “Hey, we can devote our youth, our energy and our time to something that actually matters. And something that matters for a billion people.” Privacy and security could be a really good business, but it’s also important for the world, regardless of being good business. It’s just important for people. So, that’s how we started. All right, so you ... but you have other things you do on the service, correct? We do. We started initially with Wi-Fi security. Then we added internet freedom and privacy. And most recently we added protection from phishing, malware and spam. So it’s a more comprehensive security product, which protects consumers from most of their mobile security threats of today. Where most of it happens on mobile. Although, you can do it on a computer. Exactly. Yeah, this has been sort of an area peopled by a lot of big competitors; Symantec, and others, over the years. So talk about how it’s morphed. Because obviously, it’s become a mobile issue. People are much more connected, almost always on. In computers, you weren’t always on, necessarily. You may’ve had it open at home, but it wasn’t used. Right. So, talk a little bit about how the challenges have changed. And how do you compete against ... Because there’s tons of these VPN sites. I’ve used them in China, I’ve used them lots of places. But not as a regular occurrence. So, let me first start by saying that I think, and you know this really well, security and privacy threats are exponentially growing. You’re seeing things like Equifax getting hacked, you’re seeing Cambridge Analytica. Well, that wasn’t a hack. It was a use. Yes, that was selling of user data, right? All these vulnerabilities, of the Crack vulnerability, which was found last year in all Wi-Fi hotspots that people thought were secure and they weren’t. All these security and privacy challenges are just exponentially growing. And the companies, the biggest companies in the world around security, some of the companies you mentioned, are selling ... McAfee. A lot of the old-school security companies are selling, sort of, PC antivirus at Best Buy. Right? And we’re in 2018, and we’ve got massive security and privacy threats happening on our mobile phones. And so, we’re not seeing the old-school security companies addressing these challenges. As a matter of fact, if you look at most of them, most of their revenue is coming from the old PC business and their mobile revenue is tiny. And so, we wanted ... we gotta set out on a path to build the next-generation security and privacy company that’s really gonna be for 2018 and for the future. And it’s mobile-centric, and it’s around protecting the privacy of your data that’s being collected by a bunch of third parties. It’s also about protecting users from phishing, which is a very big multi-billion dollar problem for consumers and businesses. And malware. And so, we’re just not seeing a lot of solutions, we’re seeing a lot of challenges. So we believe we have the opportunity to build the next-gen security company. Now you’ve raised how ... You’re a profitable company, correct? We have been a profitable company for many years. But, you’ve just raised an enormous amount of money. Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah. We raised a fairly sizable round. This is the fourth investment we have taken. And we’ve basically raised it for several reasons. One is really around what I was just saying, that there is an opportunity to build the next-generation security company that will secure the privacy and security of the next billion consumers and thousands of businesses. To do that, we’re building new products to add to our ... to Hotspot Shield, to create a security and privacy suite. We’re also looking for M&amp;A, some with new products that are gonna be geared towards protecting the security and privacy of the next billion people. We’re gonna build some, then we’re gonna buy. And we believe that it’s really not about having one product, but a comprehensive suite, where the next group of consumers and businesses that are thinking about their privacy and security. They’re just gonna subscribe to this, or even use it for free. We always have a freemium model. So you raised how much? How much did you raise in this round? Close to $300 million. And you had raised previously? We raised $63 million before. So, this was a big leap. And who is investing in this? It’s a group of investors. The lead investor is WndrCo, which is a holding and investment company started by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Sujay Jaswa and Ann Daly. And the other investors include Accel. Accel Partners and several others funds. Several others. And so, the idea is that you’ve gone along with a small amount of money, $63 million isn’t very much. And now you have to up the game, in this regard. Yeah, essentially we want to build a product suite that a billion people will use for free and a hundred million people will pay for. And to do that, it’s a combination of products for security and privacy that we have to put together and build. And we’re looking at M&amp;A as a pretty important focus area. We’re gonna be looking very carefully at interesting technologies that we can add to our suite. Right, so talk about your business. How do you make money? And in the next section, we’ll talk about the risks people have and that you’re seeing and stuff like that. But talk about that. Sure. So we generate revenue from a freemium business model, similar to a Dropbox or a Spotify. People download Hotspot Shield. They can start using it for free. And at certain points, we ask people to pay. We have users that use us for free forever. We have users that have been using us for five, six, seven years for free. But, at the same time, we have a percent of our users that are paying a subscription. It’s $12.99 a month or $75 a year. And that provides security and privacy for up to five devices. A lot of businesses are also buying it. A lot of people are buying it for their families. CFOs are using us, people on Wall Street are using us. A lot of people use us to protect their health data. But generally, it’s a freemium model where you get more and more services beyond a lower level of service. Correct? Correct. And what is the growth you’re seeing? Is it just as a VPN business, where people ... Where do you ... Or is it just different globally? The growth we’re seeing is mostly around mobile security and privacy. We’re seeing, as I mentioned, 250,000 new users every single day. So what are they looking for? What are they ... They are looking for one of these four things. Either security and Wi-Fi. Privacy protection, even at home. You don’t want Comcast or whoever to see what you’re doing online. Protection from phishing, malware and spam. And also access to global content that may not be available in certain places, like the example of Egypt. But I’ll tell you one interesting trend that’s happened over the last few years. Our usage has shifted heavily from being emerging markets-focused to being U.S.-focused. Huh. So you’re going the opposite direction. It’s very interesting, right? Typically, people start in the U.S., get market share. Yeah. Right. We’re very different. We’re a California-based company. All of our employees are here, and yet our usage for a very long time was primarily ... Based in Egypt and China. Exactly, emerging markets. Over the last two years, that has changed materially. We still are big in emerging markets and still are growing, but the U.S. is now like 50 percent of our usage. It’s just incredible. And you’re feeling ... Why is that? Couple of things. We saw a major spike when the FCC allowed ISPs to sell user data. We saw a major spike with the repeal of net neutrality. We saw a major spike in usage with the Crack vulnerability in Wi-Fi. Cambridge Analytica. All these things where people realized that, “Hey, my privacy is being compromised without my consent and my security is at risk.” All these things have caused major spikes. And this is people in the U.S. who thought they were not ... They were not bought and paid for, essentially. Exactly. Essentially, three years ago, people in the U.S. just didn’t care about privacy and security. And today that has changed in a fairly massive way. To a point that if you look in the App Store, what are the top 50 most-downloaded apps? You’ll see Facebook, you’ll see Twitter, and you’ll see a bunch of games. Alex Jones, for a second. But, thank God that changed. But, go ahead. You’ll see us. Yeah. There’s actually two apps that we own and operate that you’ll see in the top 50. Which are? Hotspot Shield and Betternet. And what’s the second one do? It’s essentially the same thing, only it’s targeting a younger demographic, more student focused. Hotspot Shield is more business professional focused. I see. Okay. What do students need? That is more ... Hipper language? Exactly. Different branding. Okay. But, it’s essentially almost every app in the top 50 apps on iPhone makes most of their revenue from selling data to advertisers. Right? Right. We make most of our revenue from protecting your data. From advertisers and others. From ISPs, from whoever. Right? Right. So, I firmly believe that the first three companies that essentially got to a billion people online were first Yahoo, then Google, then Facebook. I believe the next company that gets to a billion people online is going to be in the business of protecting your data. From those people. From those people. Those people are in the business of selling your data. All right. That’s a perfect segue. Let’s talk a little bit about what people should be worried about and what they shouldn’t. Maybe we’ll start on what they shouldn’t be worried about. What are some hype things that people should not think about? We just surveyed our users and we asked them, “Do you care about privacy and security? And if so, when?” What we learned is that most people said that 70 percent of the time, they actually didn’t care about their privacy, they were happy to share pictures on Facebook or whatever. But 30 percent of the time, almost everyone said they cared about their privacy enormously. That 30 percent was when it came to things like your healthcare, your finances and your family. People said, “Look, if I’m communicating with my friends and family, I want those conversations to stay private. If I’m doing some kind of financial transaction, logging into my bank, I want that to be private. If I’m researching things on WebMD or on Google around my healthcare, I want those things to be private, but other times I’m happy to be public and not be private.” So, a lot of people have said, “Hey, are you going to disrupt business models of people that are ... of like Google and Facebook?” and I said, “I don’t think so.” Because essentially, I believe that there is a reason and an opportunity to provide privacy and security for billing people or more, and they may not need to be private and secure all the time. I think that if 70 percent of the time they’re like, “Look, we’re happy to share our data,” that’s fine. But that 30 percent of the time where people want to be private, they should have the ability to click a very easy button and protect themselves. So, let’s talk about what’s at risk, what people don’t realize. When I was using a VPN, I still use a VPN, I was somewhere and still using it, he was like, “Don’t use that, they have” — I’m not going to name them, but they’re from China. Explain what the problems are with some of these things. There’s a number of problems with using security products from companies that are not well known, or not known at all. In the VPN industry, specifically, there’s some well-known players, there is AnchorFree, there’s Symantec and McAfee and Kaspersky and Bitdefender, sort of like, people in the security space that you kinda know. Even Verizon just launched a VPN, right? Samsung launched a VPN and that’s fine, and there is like all these sort of … Yeah, the people collecting your data, launching a VPN. Obviously. Well look, let’s talk about that in a sec. Okay. Then there is completely unknown players, and so consumers and businesses have to do a little bit of research and say, “Hey, are these people transparent about how they collect and treat data? Do they share data with governments, do they …?” whatever else. There are VPN companies that are, um, like a lot of VPN companies don’t disclose who’s on their board, who’s on their management team, who are their investors, have they ever issued a transparency report? There is an independent report that was published today, actually, from AV-Test, which is a German security auditor. They analyze the security space. They have been around for a long time, they’ve been analyzing antivirus products and other things. So they just issued a report on VPNs, and what they found was that most VPN companies shared no transparency. This is a trust and transparency report. AV-Test specifically studied how transparent are these companies with their data-collection practices, and also who they are and their jurisdiction and all these things. They found that most of the industry didn’t disclose even their location, their management teams, their CEO, nothing. Pretty scary. One of them happens to be in China, which is even more scary. Then they studied who has issued a transparency report, and they found actually there is only three companies in the VPN space. Explain what a transparency report would do. A transparency report is a legal official statement, a document, which shows how many subpoenas or requests for information ... From government. From various governments around the world a company has received, and how much information have they shared. Right. When you’re thinking about security and privacy, it’s fairly important the products you use are run by companies that are transparent and they have transparency reports. And will resist subpoenas, incorrect subpoenas. Exactly, and will either resist, or even better, will just have no information to share because of the way they’re architected. See because resisting subpoenas, it’s a very hard game, especially for startups. The best way to protect user data is to not collect it, because then you don’t have to resist anything, you just have nothing to hand over. This AV-test report found that only three companies in the VPN space, for both consumers and businesses, have issued transparency reports. Those three companies were Cisco, Avast and AnchorFree. Nobody else has issued a transparency report, and according to the transparency reports both Cisco and Avast shared information with law enforcement or with governments, different governments around the world. AnchorFree is the only company that hasn’t shared any information. And why? The reason is very simple. You just don’t have it? We just don’t have it. We’ve gotten over a hundred subpoenas over the last two years, we just have nothing to share. Right, no matter what they’re asking for, you’re like ... It’s very simple: The best way to protect user data is to not log it or store it. Right. So, if you don’t have it, you have nothing to hand over. So it just passes through you, is really what’s going on. Exactly. So, what else should people be worried about? Let’s start with just regular case scenarios. One is don’t go with a VPN that’s based in China. That’s kind of basic. Yeah. Which Kara Swisher did, thank you very much. So get a company that is transparent about how it deals with subpoenas, how it deals with the information, that doesn’t collect information. That’s one. Two, what about in public spaces, using public Wi-Fi’s? Super important to use VPN. Tell people why, again and again. What do people do? Every time you connect to a public Wi-Fi, it’s super easy … let’s say you are sitting at the airport and you’re connecting to the San Francisco airport Wi-Fi, it’s super easy for a hacker to pretend that he or she is the San Francisco airport Wi-Fi and you are actually connecting through that hacker to the San Francisco airport Wi-Fi, and they are seeing in plain text everything you’re doing, your passwords, your emails. They won’t necessarily see your passwords if you don’t use them, correct? Correct. They’re seeing whatever you’re doing. Whatever you’re doing. Right. The same thing if you’re using inflight Wi-Fi. A lot of us people that fly for business use Wi-Fi all the time and fly. Yes, I did that last night. Yeah, super easy for hackers to see what you’re doing. And so, even if the network is safe, it’s secure, it doesn’t matter because everyone is connecting with the same password. Right. So what we do is essentially, if you turn on Hotspot Shield, we encrypt your whole network. It just looks like a bunch of gibberish to the hacker. So even if a hacker is trying to inspect your traffic, and even if you by accident connect through a hacker machine to the Wi-Fi, it doesn’t matter because it’ll take them 10 years to decrypt whatever you’re doing. Right, and pointless. And pointless. It’s most likely an email to your mother or something like that. Exactly. So, that’s one, don’t get on public anything. Which, people don’t listen to. If you get on to public Wi-Fi, very simple … Be protected. Use protection, right, use protection when connecting to public Wi-Fi. Hotspot Shield is free, there is a free version, or others. The other thing is, you’re in the privacy of your own home, and your internet service provider is tracking what you’re doing. Another major challenge for people … What do they track exactly, so people can know? Everything, every website you visit, everything you do, the whole data stream. Now some of it may be useless, they may not care about your email to your mother, but there’s other stuff that may be useful. I’ll give you a practical example … Look at or go to Amazon, look at or go to this. Well here’s the worst possible scenario. A colleague of mine went to Stanford hospital, and the people at Stanford told him, “Look, if you’re going to be researching health-related things on Google or WebMD, make sure you use some kind of protection, because that information is sold to your insurance company and your premiums could go up.” That’s kind of the worst scenario of your data being collected by legitimate corporations without your consent. It’s supposed to be anonymized, right? Not necessarily ... Yeah, it’s supposed to be. Yes, but they can guess, correct? Yeah. So, they can take information and piece it together, about you particularly, even though it’s supposed to be anonymized or put in a bulk, correct? Totally. But people can find them rather easily, from what I understand. Very easily. Very easily. The other big problem is ... You know, everybody is concerned about Facebook selling user data, but actually there is a bigger concern, which is Facebook buying user data. Right, I’d love to talk about that, because they don’t, I mean, Mark Zuckerberg interestingly at the hearing said “we don’t sell your data,” what they do is combine it with lots of other things and then sell the insights. Exactly. The concern … That’s the more dangerous thing. Exactly. Facebook could argue that if you go to Facebook and you “Like” certain things and you post certain things, you’ve sort of given Facebook that information. Whether you agree with that or not … Right, signals. But when you go to WebMD, you never gave Facebook anything, but if they buy that information and combine it with your Facebook profile, now they know not only the things you “Liked” on Facebook, they actually know basically your healthcare history, and that’s pretty scary. That’s a real concern. That they piece it together, they did that with Acxiom, they were combining things, there were voter registration things, they can combine it with any other outside data, and it’s enough to really be able to track you rather anonymously, yet not, correct? So what that does is they can’t see any traffic, they can’t see any traffic. If consumers or businesses start using Hotspot Shield, they can’t see any traffic. All right, what else is a danger? You’re traveling abroad? So, you’re traveling abroad, hackers, obviously, trying to see what you’re doing, trying to steal your data, you’re paying with PayPal from abroad, you’re doing other things. I mean, we see a lot of businesses, small- and medium-size businesses, using us. We recently launched Hotspot Shield for Business, for their employees that are traveling a lot, connecting in public Wi-Fi, to stay secure and private. Then there is phishing, so you know, people get emails, looks like it’s from your bank, you click on it and it actually looks like the banking site. Yeah, it does. You know, they ask for your login and password and they steal it, and they can log into your bank account. So we block 36 million malware and phishing domains that are updated daily. So you can’t get to ’em. Yeah, so if you click on an email that looks like it’s from your bank and it’s really a phishing site, we will block it and we will notify you. That’s sort of, when we’re talking the security and privacy challenges of the future versus the PC antivirus of the past, that’s really what we’re talking about. There are major concerns about data collection, by ISPs, by governments, by hackers. There are major concerns about Wi-Fi usage, which, everybody uses Wi-Fi. There are major concerns about phishing and there are major concerns about malware, and combining all that into one solution is what we’re trying to do here. All right, so what’s the far-out problem that people should worry about? Those are things that people have heard of. What is the most, what is the latest thing? The other major challenge is that we’re moving to a world where we’re going to have more than 25 billion connected devices through IoT, and my mattress today is actually a smart mattress. What? So I have a little thing called Sleep Tracker on my mattress, it reports back how well I sleep. Alright. Right. Our refrigerators are going to be smart. Right, the Google homes and the Amazon Alexa ... Exactly, the Nest thermostats, all these things. I have a Nest thermostat in the home I just bought, I don’t know what to do with it. Well, at least you didn’t buy the one from the Chinese company. I didn’t, no, I put a bag on it already, I have a bag on it. It’s really a beautiful piece of art, actually. It’s a beautifully designed thing but ... It’s probably listening to you. Oh, it’s not going to be listening, it’s got a bag and a pillow on it, but go ahead, I’ll be taking it down, I’ll be taking it down. Nice. But yeah, that’s ... Like I need more Google in my home anyway. Exactly. So that’s the thing, where your home is becoming smart and all this information is being reported through the internet to various places — your doctor, the store, whatever — and protecting all that information is extremely important. Like a crazy stat that I read is that 90 percent of all the data collected about us and known about us to date has been collected over the last two years. Right, wow. Which is a pretty crazy stat because if you think about the next five years, and we’ve got 25 billion new devices connected, we have five billion new internet users coming online. Our information is going to be exponentially larger. It’s going to be a convenience for a lot of us, it’s going to be convenient that we can get information about how well we sleep or what we eat and get your refrigerator to order milk when you’re running out. That’s all convenience. But it’s also a major, major concern, and a goldmine for hackers. Right, 100 percent. And I think what people need to realize is they’re giving it away without a fight, you know, without even thinking about it. Exactly, exactly. It’s sort of like leaving their door open. And you know what? It’s super-simple to protect yourself, that’s the thing. That’s what … I think what most people don’t understand is that it’s super, super simple to use a very easy security and privacy solutions to protect your data. Let’s talk about the bigger picture of privacy. This has been something that’s been, you know, largely because of the recent things around the elections, which wasn’t really hacking, and it wasn’t really privacy, it’s just the misuse of these social platforms which have an enormous amount of data, and I think the focus has been on the enormous amount of data they have about people. This time, it was sold to a group that then used it for election things. I think that we’ll have no way of knowing if it had an impact, but we have the vague sense that, yes, it absolutely did. There was false advertising on Facebook and Twitter, and some on Google and YouTube. There was fake news, which is a whole ‘nother problem. There was the lack of transparency in ads, especially political ads. Let’s talk about the bigger picture. Of course, this country has pretty much done no discernible regulation of the internet in any way, in order to allow it to grow, which I think most people feel, it’s been a pretty good trade-off. But now, people are ... Those chickens are coming home to roost, I think, in a lot of ways. So talk to me about the bigger picture and where we are. There’s an incredible amount of data that’s going to be available about us in the coming years, and whether it’s coming from our IOT devices … In the last two years, yeah. Or mobile phones or whatnot, and there’s a need to protect the data. Consumers deserve the right and businesses deserve the right to have very simple common-sense protection for their information. But at the same time, there’s a lot of forces out there that don’t want ... No, why would you? That don’t want privacy, and you know there’s a lot of you know, whether it’s governments around the world or corporations or hackers that have great incentives for our data to not be protected. Right. There’s one group that just wants to steal our information so they can raid our bank accounts or raid our credit cards. That’s one, that’s the hackers. Right. Those have been around ... Bank robbers have been around since the beginning of time. That’s essentially what they are, but they’re just using more sophisticated means to do so. Or to take people’s profiles or whatever. Whatever nefarious uses. Exactly. The other is a group of people that wanna use it to affect elections, to create discord and all kinds of things. That’s the Russians or the Iranians or whoever. Even the United States in some countries. And then there’s governments who want to know everything about you in order to control you, if they’re more fascist governments that want that information. And then there’s the Facebooks and Googles of the world that just want to make a buck off of you. Exactly. So it’s coming from everywhere. It’s coming from everywhere and there’s very few that are saying, “Hey how do we protect all of this data? And how do we really put the consumer or the business in control of their own information?” Mm-hmm. For me, having started AnchorFree when I was 23 years old and being very naïve and idealistic, this is both a business issue, a technology issue and a moral issue. I actually morally think that it’s the right thing to do, to provide people this basic human right of privacy where every user has the ability to click a button and protect their information. Right. But at a high level, I’ve been watching legislature ... This was maybe eight years ago, you probably remember there’s this thing called Do Not Track in Congress. It hung out there forever and nothing really happened. Yeah, that sounds about right. What happened to the Honest Ads Act? That didn’t pass, right? There’s all this kind of stuff. I’ll tell you, I had dinner in D.C. with the only FCC commissioner who voted against the repeal of net neutrality in the current FCC. And also Reed Hundt, who was the chairman of the FCC under Bill Clinton [and] has been on my board of advisers for quite some time. We’ve been discussing these issues and I kind of ... we’re very strong supporters of net neutrality. But kind of came at it and said, “You know what, let the policy makers do whatever they do. We’re going to provide a technological solution to this and we want a software development kit that essentially any app developer can integrate and preserve net neutrality.” It disrupts that ability for internet service providers to discriminate against their traffic because we anonymize the way the traffic looks. You don’t know if it’s from ... You don’t know if it’s Netflix, Twitter or YouTube. It all looks like AnchorFree and so you can’t discriminate. At a high level, I think that the technology industry needs to provide these technology solutions to privacy. Because I don’t know if governments will get there. Although Europe certainly has taken the first step, GDPR. Everybody argues it’s a huge annoyance. People had to change their practices, it’s a pain, right? Mm-hmm. But I do think it’s the right thing to do. I honestly do because it’s the first step in the right direction. So Europe’s been the most stringent, in terms of putting the ... They have. And a lot of things. A right to not be known, which is very difficult. It does get in the way of these people’s businesses, pretty much. And their argument now is the more regulations, the better off for us, because we can maintain them while small players... That’s their new argument, just so you know. Okay, probably they’re right on that one, I have to say, it’s a good argument to make. So don’t put regulations in, and therefore we will eventually get overcome by other startups, that’s I think their general ... It’s a fascinating argument. It’s interesting. Well, that’s great. So we’re going to try to overcome them. Yes, exactly. So there’s that ... that’s one. Then there’s here in California, a privacy bill that not everybody’s happy with but it is certainly the most stringent in the nation in terms of protecting privacy. It doesn’t look like there’s going to be any movement in the U.S. government in terms of federal, correct? Am I wrong about that? I mean they threaten it. I think there’s going to be a lot of bills. I don’t actually know, if anything’s going to pass. Right. They threaten all kinds of things like content moderation bills, algorithm transparency bills, bills around ... That’ll be interesting. That’ll never pass. Yeah. I personally support a lot of the stuff, but at the same time, sort of the grain of salt, in that being I actually think a lot of it is more philosophical than practical. Philosophically, you’re like California, into privacy, great. And then practically, you’re like, “I don’t know if this stuff ...” Works. “Is it going to work, is it going to pass?” And so I still think from where we’re sitting, we’re looking at a lot of global issues. Our business is built on this intersection of human rights, foreign policy and technology. And we’re looking at the world and we’re saying, “Look, we have more faith in ourselves providing technology solutions, like we did with net neutrality.” Mm-hmm. Because we got tired of talking about it with politicians and we just launched technology that actually enables any app developer for free to preserve net neutrality if they want to. And in the same way we’re just going to provide common-sense tech solutions to some of these most pressing global challenges. Hopefully people in businesses will adopt them. I mean, so far it’s certainly working. Mm-hmm. So what do you imagine is going to pass? Is there any federal legislation? I don’t. Yeah, I don’t. I don’t know. Yeah. They’ll pass a ... The recent one is the idea that they should nationalize internet companies. That’s an insane one. That’s a Laura Ingraham inanity that I think will probably pass. But is there anything that you think has any chance? Any privacy bill? I honestly don’t know. I would like to see more countries take the route that Europe has. Mm-hmm. Are there any countries that are gonna do that? I don’t know. I really don’t know. Well, not China, we know that. Exactly. Yeah. Not Russia, not China. But none of them will, I don’t think. I don’t think so. Yeah. You might see some bills in certain countries where Facebook is having bad impacts, them passing bills to restrict the usage of things like that. But nothing else, really. What would be the perfect bill for you, for the U.S.? I mean, ideally you’d have something where consumers would have to opt in if they wanted their data to be collected for some reason. An Internet Bill of Rights, per se. Right. And opt out when they didn’t and it’d be really simple. I mean, if it’s a 12-page privacy policy it doesn’t work. But if it’s like one button: I want to be private or I don’t want to be private. Something like that. Again, I just think there’s this massive opportunity in the private sector to provide solutions for privacy and security. Right, if the government’s not gonna to do it. I just think it’ll move a lot faster. We’ll continue to support these things. What about self-regulation of some of these companies that make all their money? Like the Facebooks and Googles of the world. They keep saying they will have the control. Well, you saw what happened to the Facebook stock around having to implement GDPR in Europe. Right. The European revenue suffered, like for real. So it’s very hard for them to self-regulate in a material way. Not in a PR type of way, but in a real way. Yes, that’s a really good distinction. They seriously lose revenue if they can’t sell private data. Right. I would argue that they’re thinking long term. If people are only concerned about protecting their data 30 percent of the time, it may not be a bad idea for these companies to say, “Look, let’s let people tell us when that 30 percent is and we won’t track them. For real.” Mm-hmm. “And yes, our revenue will go down in the short term, but in the long term, the trust in our brand ...” Right. Yeah. “Our consumers are going to like us a lot more.” Absolutely, the product becomes less of a feeling you’re being tracked. I don’t think there’s anybody in the world today that trusts Facebook. I think they use ’em, it’s a great product, your friends are there and you want to hang out with your friends. But I don’t think anyone trusts them. That’s the thing. That’s the thing. And if they wanted to earn that trust ... The same thing, actually, for governments. I don’t think there’s a lot of people that trust the government here, but I don’t know if that’s true for Europe. I actually think a lot of Europeans, a lot of Germans, will tell you they actually trust their government with their data because of these things like GDPR. I think if I was a government of some country and I wanted to earn that trust, in a post-Snowden world and stuff, I would go support things like GDPR because actually that earns trust. Right. Where do you think it’s going now? As you were saying, last two years, we’ve gotten all this data downloaded about us. There’s more and more devices that people are embracing. And there’ll be more glasses, clothing, embedded technology in people. We’ll have some sort of phone in our ear at some point that we have, we just have. So the solution right now are these smaller companies that are making hay out of the abuses of the bigger companies. As long as those companies have real technology and real architecture around those technologies to really protect the user, then yes. If those companies are sort of operations in a garage that are making a lot of noise and are actually not truly protecting user information, then they’re actually worse. Because they’re actually fooling people into believing that they’re protected when they’re not. Really, I think there may be a couple of things that could happen. One, the big security companies wake up and start innovating. They haven’t innovated for a while because they’re mostly owned by private equity firms and all they’re doing is milking ... Milking it, right? Milking the cash. Right. But one scenario is that they wake up they’re like, “This is a big business opportunity. Let’s go innovate.” The second is startups like AnchorFree come around and disrupt the space, which we’re hoping to do. The third, that some of these big corporations will self-regulate in a real way, probably not. Mm-hmm. Simply because it seriously hurts their bottom line. That governments will sort of follow Europe? Maybe, but probably very slowly. And not in the next five years, I don’t think. But the other thing is, security and privacy go hand in hand. You really can’t have one without the other. So if you really want to build really secure systems, but yet you still want to collect user data, that’s a challenge. Really, for the next billion people. I think the future is gonna be yes, you have all these hundreds of connected devices. Your life is always connected. But for that 30 percent of time where you want to be private? You’re just gonna have the security and privacy suite you’re gonna subscribe to just like you subscribe to Netflix. You’re just gonna have it. Right. And everyone’s going to have it. The next billion people. Every American’s gonna have it. And it’s just gonna protect you when you need that protection. Yeah. It’s too bad we can’t just be protected. It’s kind of funny, it’s like hiring your own private security force when you should be ... But you can, the great thing is that you can. Right. Like, you look in the app store and we’re right there in the top 50. Yeah, yeah. People are waking up and ... And figuring it out. They’re figuring it out. It’s not a great realization. So, to finish up, the thing we have to do is get yourself that kind of protection... Name the three things that people should do. Definitely use Hotspot Shield for ... Or someone else. Or someone else. Use a security product to protect yourself at public Wi-Fi and protect your internet even at home and at work. Two, I would suggest using a good password manager. I use 1Password. Yeah, they’re great actually. I still don’t understand it but go ahead. So, that’s two. Three, there’s all kinds of things that you can opt out of like face recognition on Facebook. Which I really recommend people do. Yeah. A lot of people don’t really ... What about on Apple? Apple ... It stores it on the phone. Yeah, it’s local, so it shouldn’t be that much of a concern. But you can opt out of it if you’re concerned. Yeah. Certainly you can use Incognito on your browser. But again, like 87 percent of our usage is in apps. Explain Incognito for people. Incognito just means your browser is not gonna collect the websites you visit. Right. Right. But, that shouldn’t be mistaken that your IP address, which is the number your ISP gives you, will still be collected by all those websites. Right, exactly. Unless you use VPN. Right, absolutely. This has been really interesting with David Gorodyansky, he’s the CEO of AnchorFree, and he’s doing God’s work, as far as I’m concerned. If you really are worried about all the information these companies have on you, and you should be, please use his products and all the other security products that we have to protect ourselves with. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you, Kara.

Full Q&A: 2U CEO Chip Paucek on Recode Decode," Paucek says online education started out with a bad reputation, but now people are starting to take it seriously. On the latest episode of Recode Decode, 2U CEO Chip Paucek said the idea of taking college courses online has turned a corner. Starting with USC, Georgetown and UNC Chapel Hill, his company struck deals with name-brand graduate schools to get some distance from the connotation of “online college” as a huckster’s playground. “The great schools weren’t doing anything online, and we really believed that you could do something great if you had institutional will to make the students equal, end the segregation of the online student,” Paucek said. “Give them the real rights, the real degree, the same quality, the same faculty, but you needed a great school to buy in.” Ten years since starting the company, Paucek still says it’s “early days” for 2U — after all, some of its partners are hundreds of years old — but he believes that the future of higher ed has to be online. At the end of the day, however, the classes the company offers will depend on talented professors who may be accustomed to physical classrooms to teach them. “There’s one particular professor in the Chapel Hill program that we really kept trying to push to do some of the newer things and he kept sort of insisting on wanting to do it the way that he’s comfortable,” Paucek said. “So we ended up filming him and letting him do his thing. Even though it has fewer bells and whistles, it’s the second-highest rated course. Why? Because he’s brilliant.” You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Kara’s conversation with Chip. Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is Chip Paucek, the CEO of 2U. It partners with colleges and universities to offer online programs. He co-founded the company more than 10 years ago. Chip, welcome to Recode Decode. Chip Paucek: Oh, thank you. Thrilled to be here. Good. We have a lot to talk about. I was just telling you, I was just interviewing the head of the World Bank, so you’re coming off of a thing. But one of the things he was talking about was online stuff. He was very interested in that and not investing in bridges and tunnels, but more in those kind of programs. And one of the things he noted to me was that he got the head of Dubai to pay for turning all of Sal Khan’s stuff into Arabic, to get it translated into Arabic, and he employed like 7,000 people at once, and that was not a World Bank program I would’ve seen before. I just wanna talk a little bit about your company and then we wanna talk about where education’s going and where it should be going. Well, I started the company over a decade ago. We partner with top universities to build really high-quality online programs. Right. Where were you before that? That’s a great story. So, this is the third venture-backed startup for me and the only that worked. So I produced a PBS television show for a really long time, my first one, and it produced a bunch of celebrities, which is really cool. Which was? It was called “Standard Deviance.” It was middle school, high school, college courses taught by comedians and actors. So like, TJ Miller from “Silicon Valley.” Oh, him. Yeah. And Kerry Washington from “Scandal,” so a bunch of great actors, but ultimately, the business wasn’t successful, so it didn’t return capital and whatnot, but I learned a ton. Then I ran Hooked on Phonics, so I was CEO of Hooked on Phonics for ... We all remember that. Explain what Hooked on Phonics ... I know what it is. Hooked on Phonics is a reading program for kids. The famous one with the infomercials. “Hooked on Phonics worked for me.” Yeah. It was like Kars4Kids. You remember them. I think I was on QVC like 35 times or some nonsense, selling Hooked on Phonics. So, yes. I’ve had an interesting career, all in education. Where did that go? Where did Hooked on Phonics go? Hooked on Phonics has been through a bunch of different owners. I honestly don’t know where it is now. I left to start 2U. It was called Tutor at the time. So, my career has been all in education, except for one stint where I ran a U.S. Senator’s reelection campaign, Barbara Mikulski from here in Maryland. Baltimore. That’s my backstory. I get, interestingly ... Sorry, why did you run Barbara Mikulski’s campaign? I thought you’d ask that. I haven’t thought about her. Man, she is something. Right out of college, I graduated from GW, and right out of college, people forget how rough the job market was in ’92, and I got a job working for Barbara Mikulski as, basically, her assistant scheduler, which is the funny ... it’s like the worst job on the Hill because basically all you do is say “no” because the scheduler takes the yeses. I got to know her really personally and when I started my first company, she’s like, “Why are you leaving?” and I gave her a business plan. Next day, I come in and — one of the cooler days of my career — there’s a Senate wax seal envelope and I open it up and there’s a check. And she became my third investor in my first company. Wow. Oh, cool. I’d go to the Hill every quarter to tell her what was going on in the company. Ultimately, I didn’t make her any money. Oh, poor Barbara. And then at the end, she asked me to come and be her deputy campaign manager, so I co-ran her campaign in 2004. Yeah, 2004. Oh, wow. She was a great politician. It was an incredible experience. And then I started 2U [after] leaving Hooked on Phonics. What was the impetus for it? To teach, right? To find new ways of teaching? If it was 10 years ago, it was early days. It was very early days. I remember Miles Gilburne had one, a reading one. There was a lot of early, early versions of this. We really believed that the world was ready for really high-quality online education, but people thought we were kind of crazy. People thought we were loons, honestly. At the time, no one was doing anything online from any of the great schools, so I would argue it was like the first wave of online ed where it was all for-profit, and I’m sure we’re gonna talk about that. But for-profit education has a bad rap for a reason. For a long time, it wasn’t particularly very good. Right. University of Arizona or whatever. You mean University of Phoenix. Phoenix. Sorry, yeah. And Phoenix was better than many of them. Yeah, but there were lots of those. There were lots of those. Right. The great schools weren’t doing anything online, and we really believed that you could do something great if you had institutional will to make the students equal, end the segregation of the online student. Give them the real rights, the real degree, the same quality, the same faculty, but you needed a great school to buy in. And it’s not obvious why they said yes, but we were able to convince University of Southern California to sign up with us, and then Georgetown, your alma mater, and then University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. What was the pitch during those days? Harvard and MIT were relatively early, though it wasn’t 10 years ago. No, really, at this point, USC and Georgetown and Chapel Hill, they all took a huge risk that they didn’t have any data to support the decision. The pitch was, this is where the world’s gonna go and we really believed it could be great. The university had to be convinced, first of all, that it was gonna be extremely high-quality, that this wasn’t gonna be some dumbed-down version of what they’ve done because. If you think about it, companies don’t last this long. My youngest university partner is 12 years older than Walt Disney. Companies just don’t last this long, so be really careful about that brand experience and the high quality and delivering the student outcome. We were pretty passionate. We were able to convince University of Southern California first to give it a shot, and then quickly thereafter, Georgetown, and then after that, Chapel Hill. Explain the initial offering. The initial offer was, we’re gonna bring you online, 2U will be behind the scenes. What’s interesting is most people have never heard of the company even though we’re four-and-a-half years public and one of the better-performing technology stocks, because my job is to work behind the scenes to promote and support Georgetown and USC, not 2U. The pitch was we’re gonna do a bunch of things that you don’t particularly do typically or do that well. You’re gonna do all instruction. You’re gonna grant the degree. You’re gonna make the admissions decision in terms of who gets in. You’ll do all accreditation. You’ll do everything that you’d want your university to do, so it’s like the real thing. And I’ll provide the tech platform, all the student support, all the faculty support, things like clinical placements. As an example, one of my degrees at Georgetown is a Master of Science in Midwifery. You wouldn’t wanna go to the midwife that delivered the virtual baby, right? No, not at all. We have a huge clinical placement network. Back then, that was all something that we had to build. I give those early schools a ton of credit because we weren’t very good at it in 2008 and we had to learn. So the pitch then, one of them ... I was just at a university the other day and someone, I think it was the head of the university, was like, “We’re not gonna have this school in 30 years.” He was talking about various different things. And you see all these iterations, and we’ll get to that later. But when you were selling them on it, obviously they wanted more students in the doors, not outside the doors or coming in. Right. But the key is the right students for them. In other words, what they represent in the community, the quality of student, the quality of faculty that they’ve built their history on. And in the case of Georgetown, it’s 100 years older than Coca-Cola. You’re talking about some of the oldest standing institutions in our culture. 1876, no, I know. If you look across my portfolio, like Yale is 75 years older than America. I mean, these schools, pretty credible. But what was the pitch to them for you? That they needed to have more students or that they were missing students or what? Expand their mission and reach and drive new revenue for the school. It’s both ... it’s sort of a combination of mission and dollars. Sustainability is not optional, so it needs to all be sustainable and work, but it was all about quality to start. So not anybody could get in. No, and I don’t make that call. Right. They make that call. Right, of who’s gonna get in. Now, the business for 2U is we stand behind the scenes, we share tuition revenue over a long contract. My shortest contract is 10 years, they’re non-cancelable. So it’s a non-trivial decision to do this on both sides. And the reason is, I’ll invest about 10 million of net-negative cash over the first four to five years of that 10-year life, before I swing to 2U’s side to profit. The university is typically good in about a year, but the money is secondary. First and foremost, will it work? And if you look at online education, unfortunately, a long history of not working for people, necessarily, the student outcome ... Well there’s different types, we can talk about the different types. But the getting in part is that this would expand their student body. For people that couldn’t go there or ... So I guess I would say, why should you pick up your life, quit your job, and move to attend a school — grad school, these are all graduate programs — why should you pick up your life, quit your job to attend if you could get everything you would get from a school like USC, but do it in your local community at that quality level, with that rigor, with that affiliation, like you’re becoming a Trojan, a Tar Heel, a Hoya, not just a random 1 and 0. So one of the things that we brought to the table that at the time people thought was truly idiotic was live classes. Our average class size across the entire portfolio is today about 14 students. So you’re talking about super-intimate live classes with the faculty, instead of just being fully asynchronous. I hate the term asynchronous because people often ... Explain that to people. It means like, the canned lec ... In an asynchronous program, you never ... You watch a lecture. You watch a lecture, basically. And then you answer questions based on ... In the 2U programs, you watch a lot of pre-recorded content, but then you go to class once a week with your faculty and your fellow students. Right, and those are all online students? They are. They are. So you’re not ... We don’t put a camera at the back of the classroom, the physical classroom, because if you were going to make a movie out of a play you wouldn’t put a camera at the back of the theater, you’d just have a crappy movie. So you make a movie, not a play. So when you’re producing for the online environment, you can do a bunch of things that wouldn’t just be recording the professor. And we do that. But then you go to class, and then you do your clinical placement. So when you put that all together, you’re talking about high-quality student outcomes, high-quality graduation rates, board pass rates. In the case of Georgetown, we really — even after we fully launched the program, we’d been running it a couple years — when we really captured the minds of the faculty was when the first set of graduates, which was a big number, passed their boards at very close to the same rate as the campus program. That was where ... that’s the rubber that meets the road. Right, very close but not quite. The on-campus program at the time was high 90s, it was like 99 point something. And we were like, half a percentage point lower. So what kind of people wanna do this? What’s the thing? That you just don’t want to leave your town or ... Well, the biggest cost to graduate education is the opportunity cost. So most people, if you’re gonna go to grad school, even like an MBA, if you’re going to a campus program you’re typically quitting your job and you’re going to campus for two years. Whatever you’re making during that two years, you’re typically either borrowing or getting from family. So the people across the entire portfolio of 2U’s programs — whether it be Speech Pathology or Physical Therapy or Data Science, sort of using extremes — they’re typically employed and they stay employed. So you’re able to continue your career, building your career or the next step in your career, without sacrificing the current job. So on balance, it’s typically a slightly older student. But I think we’re at the very front edge of this. It’s my belief that all of graduate education is gonna go this way, it’s just the value proposition to the consumer is so much better. I feel like, not that I’m gonna get out a joint and smoke it here ... Oh, we don’t do that. But I feel like the Elon Musk/Tesla stage of life is the ... Like, electric cars, you’re at such the early stage of the market, I really believe that’s where we are in online education. It’s very early days. So we think all of it will go online over time, even disciplines that you wouldn’t immediately expect. They could. And we’re gonna get to that in a second. So the people that wanna do this, what do they typically pay? The tuition cost? No, because there’s different tuitions. The tuition is the same price as the campus price. Oh wow, okay, all right, okay, so it could be super high. And are scholarships available in the same manner? If there are scholarships, most of graduate education is not ... we actually ... 2U deploys quite a few scholarships to track different groups of students. But overall, graduate education is either self-pay or loans. So if the campus tuition price is a certain price ... $5,000 or whatever, it’s not $10,000. Twenty? No, most of the programs, like an MBA will cost you somewhere between, on the low end let’s say $55,000 and on the high end $100,000 for the full program. And so the online program ... Right. That’s two years, right? That’s two years. Right. So that depends on the school. But you don’t have your room and board, and you don’t have ... you know, you’re employed during that time. So the debt burden to the student is substantially lower. Right, right, right. And then getting in, how do they split between it? Does that open their student body amount that they can allow in? Correct? You’re talking about significant size increase for the school. Now, you’re not talking about taking a school from 200 students on-campus to 10,000. Right. But the typical 2U program will enroll somewhere between 300-500 new students per year for the school. If you look at a program like Georgetown, the Nursing program at Georgetown was quite small in that case. Yeah, it was. ‘Cause most graduate education, most of the programs ... I lived with Georgetown nurses. Oh you did? Yeah, they were my roommates. They were crazy. Well, that’s a fabulous school. They’re wild. Nurses are crazy. They work like hell, but they also ... We have a lot of nursing programs, and we have three ... Talking to you, Kate Curran. But go ahead, keep going. Going back to the Nursing, but let’s not discuss partying nurses, but go ahead. This is awesome. So I would say the individual programs, you might have a student body of 50, 100, 200 students. And then in the case of our size, you get 300-500 per year, so you would have a student body between let’s say 500 and 1,000. So it’s a significant expansion for the school. It’s a good revenue source for the school. But it’s gotta work. Right. Until we have proven that we can create really high-quality graduates with good jobs and the student outcome side, no one would have continued to purchase ... And when you’re saying they have to do special classes, why do you have to segregate them? Again, I know you don’t want a camera in the back, but what’s the thinking behind that? Because that is kind of a different student, right? Well, offering a really intimate experience where you’re gonna be with your faculty. I mean, the faculty in these programs, you don’t get to Georgetown or Berkeley or Yale or any of our schools and be faculty there without being pretty exceptional. Right. So having that faculty time ... I actually took our MBA program, so I graduated, I’ve gotta be one of the only people that’s done an IPO while being in an MBA program, by the way. I didn’t do it to eat my own dog food, I didn’t do it to talk about it, I didn’t do it for the Hair Club For Men ... Who did you take, at which school? Chapel Hill. Oh, okay. And it took me four years, so I was like the longest-standing student in the history of Kenan-Flagler Business School. But kidding aside, having that experience, I could tell you: From the standpoint of the faculty interaction? Huge part of the value proposition. But then the student interaction, you remember your fellow students even more than you remember your faculty, from wherever you went to school. Right. So that intimacy of the online environment, we have a bunch of marriages that have happened in the programs, so people meeting in the program. We’re not a dating service, but ... What are you, Tinder? We’re gonna get back to that. We are not education Tinder. But the fact is, you do meet people and you become close to one another and you learn a lot from one another. We’re here with Chip Paucek, the CEO of 2U. We’re talking about him taking a course, of getting an MBA. What did you do with that then, did you start a company? No, I’m kidding. Why did you take an MBA course? Eh. My wife and my board asked me the same question when I told them I wanted to do this. They both thought I was a little insane. I had been a liberal arts graduate, so just to get into me a little bit, first-generation college graduate. Got to GW, got a Pell grant to go there. Higher ed completely changed my life, it’s hard to overstate. Met my wife at GW, we’re still together 28 years later. GW couldn’t have changed me more, but I was a liberal arts major, and I had never taken a single business course. And I get out of college and I start a company, and I just really wanted it. I had read the balance sheet for a long time but I had never made one. So Chapel Hill had been an aspirational school for me growing up, so I really wanted to do this. Did you not get in? You know, it’s interesting. I only applied to some schools in Florida, just to give you an idea, I’d been out to Florida three times in my life. I bought my first winter coat of my life with the guy who’s now my general counsel, at GW. So I hadn’t seen much of the world, but the one place I had seen, is I’d taken ... UNC. It’s a great school. Well, no. I’d taken a close-up, one of those Presidential Classroom type things, in D.C. So I’d seen the D.C. schools. Right. So I applied to GW and Georgetown and American. I didn’t get into your alma mater. I got into GW. It got harder after the basketball thing. Well, you know, GW today, it’s unbelievably intense. I wouldn’t get into Georgetown today. I wouldn’t get into GW either, today. Mine was a backup school. Georgetown used to be a backup school. That’s funny. Where was your ... I didn’t get in everywhere else. No, I didn’t get into Stanford. I didn’t apply to too many colleges. My brother was at Stanford. I keep telling — my son now is in the process — I keep telling him that there’s so many great schools and I’d be thrilled if he went to any of our partner schools, they’re all pretty exceptional. Yeah. I’m gonna try to find a way to buy a gym or something for one of them, for my kid. I’m kidding. Sadly, I did not take that job at Amazon when I was offered it 20 years ago. I cannot do that this time. In any case, let’s get back to online education. So you’re being the back end of it. Let’s talk about the landscape of where we are right now, because there’s so many MOOCs, I can’t even remember, I just called them MOOCs just now. Multi ... Massive open online courses. Whatever. OK. Well, it’s a little bit of a “whatever” there. Yes. Let’s talk about each of them, and then there’s other things, like LinkedIn bought one that was advanced. Yep. Lynda. Let’s go through each of them. So can you split them up just to where we are in online education? I would talk about three waves. The first wave I mentioned earlier was the for-profits. Unfortunately, not all of it worked, which by the way, is not good for America. Why is that? Explain what they did. Well, the first schools to go online were not the schools that we all know. They were all for-profit schools that were built to try to serve a much wider group of people. And we need more education, not less. We desperately need more college attainability. People need the access. That’s not what some Silicon Valley people think. But go ahead. Yeah. I’ll tell you, when I hear Peter Thiel talk about funding dropouts, you want to get me going? Yeah. When I hear Peter Thiel talk about anything, I get going. So let’s not go there with Peter. But the notion that somehow, most people ... You need the access. Yes, of course you do. It’s crazy. Being a three-time CEO, this is the only one that worked. This one worked to the extreme, but my first one I ran for a decade and it failed. So when people are running around Silicon Valley talking about failing forward, failing fast, give me a break. Not just that. I was with one of them and I made a Shakespeare reference and they were like, “What?” Like, “Oh my God, you didn’t finish college, did you?” I keep blaming Facebook’s problems on the fact that Mark Zuckerberg didn’t take enough humanities courses. But I now believe it’s true, actually. Well, when we are hiring today ... “Jean-Paul Sartre would help you here!” We have 2,500 employees, and when we hire, right now critical thinking, reading, writing, making an argument, being persuasive ... Referencing Shakespeare or whoever. Or Toni Morrison or anybody. Sure. It was interesting, because it’s absolutely the most important part, is having a widely read and widely referenced ... Critical. Even in tech. Of course. Most of all in tech, because they’re in charge of everything. Well, everybody loves to say, “We don’t need that now. We just need you to know the code.” So there was first the for-profits, which are just down and dirty, just the way they are in the real world. No. I think there was a lot of innovation occurring in the for-profit space. We wouldn’t be where we are if they hadn’t launched. Unfortunately, too many people selling a criminal justice degree, and it’s not obvious what somebody’s going to do with that. So if you get out and you have a bunch of debt and you don’t have an opportunity after, that’s not good. Right, yeah. It’s like Trump University, for example. Well, I’m not gonna go there. I am. Yeah, I know you are. It’s a sham and they got sued. But anyway. So there are those, but Trump University was actually one of them, was one of the many. So then what else? Then MOOCs, right? Yeah. You know what’s interesting, before the MOOCs, we’re already on the scene, just no one’s ever heard of us. Right. So there were people like me that were helping the real schools go online and offer the real thing. Going towards real schools ... Yeah. The MOOCs were a moment in time where all of a sudden everybody got captivated that online was going to ... These were the schools themselves. The schools themselves and the general ... I was pretty surprised that the New York Times, where you’re at now, was writing about it every week, because we actually didn’t think that it was gonna fundamentally change everything. It did raise people’s attention that all of a sudden ... My biggest issue as a CEO is preconceived notions of online education are bad. People think it stinks. So having all of a sudden the word “Harvard” or the word “Stanford” or “MIT” appear around online education is a positive. Right. And the way they did it is themselves, right? Correct? No. There were a bunch of companies. Oh, that’s right. Udacity, Coursera, EdX. Some nonprofit. I thought MIT did it by itself. MIT did a bunch of things by themselves. Yeah, that one course they did. They did. But then they partnered with EdX which is partly owned by MIT. Harvard and MIT own EdX. That’s right. That’s what I mean when I say they did it themselves. They did. And then there are companies like Coursera or FutureLearn that offered massive open online courses as companies, and now those companies in some ways are trying to figure out how to turn into 2U. Which is just white label, essentially. It’s more that you’re offering something ... It’s not just lifelong learning. You’re actually offering the real degree or a certificate, having achieved ... So these MOOCs are just taking courses. They’re just taking courses. Not the whole thing. Just taking courses. Or auditing, really, is what it was. That’s right. With asynchronous interaction, or interaction through forums, or interaction with all of the people who were online taking the course but not personal interaction. And then there’s continuing learning stuff. There is. There’s a bunch of that. Right. Like Lynda was that, the computer courses, a lot of them ... Linda. You probably heard of Udemy. Yep. A company that just went public about a month ago that’s run by a very good friend of mine called Pluralsight. And they ... explain what those do. Pluralsight is very intense technical training, you can think of it as Netflix for coders. Yeah. Udemy is the same way, right? So it’s very intense technical training, they IPO’d four weeks ago. So what’s interesting about ed tech is that one of the things that’s notable about our IPO, not to switch to that, is that first of all, most for-profit education hadn’t been successful, and there was really nothing like us on the market. And Wall Street likes familiarity. So our IPO was like, we’re almost like the anti-unicorn. In some ways ... I raised $102 million of venture capital and my Series D post-money was $280 million. Our IPO was half a billion. We didn’t get to big numbers until well into our public journey, so it’s a much more traditional story. Right. The reason I go there is, online education has had, it’s a tough road. What I’m proud of is, we’re paving a road ... But these advancements are interesting, because it’s the idea that continuing education is constant education. You never stop. And LinkedIn bought Lynda. They did. And then there’s ones that just help you play the banjo or learn Spanish. Yeah. You’re probably talking about Masterclass, learn acting from so and so, learn dribbling from Stephen Curry. Right. And then there’s YouTube. Which is just a big mess of videos on everything. There’s a whole bunch of video on everything. But libraries have had a ton of books for years and years and years. That’s a good way of putting it. And you need it curated. Yeah, no. They’re all on the floor. My kids use them, though, I have to say, to learn how to play Fortnite or whatever. Well, but interestingly, our kids, same age ... You don’t have a degree on Fortnite, don’t tell me that. What’s that? You don’t have a degree in Fortnite, do you? We don’t have a degree in Fortnite. No. Because my kid would be summa cum laude. But don’t you think that it’s just going the other way right now? Fortnite? What do you mean? I don’t know. I’ve been through so many of these, I just don’t remember. There was vampires at one point. In my life, my kids ... Angry Birds, another moment. Yeah. Fortnite has been big. Plants and Vampires, remember that one? Plants and Zombies. Whatever. I like that one, personally. I don’t care. I just hate them all. They’re making me buy another PS-whatever this week. PS4, yeah. I don’t know. I’m not doing it. I’m declining. And when you tell them, “Why don’t you want the old one?” Oh no. No. Anyway, let’s get back to ... So there was all these different kinds. But they’re not any one thing. What do you think is emerging? The idea of a degree system? I firmly believe that over the next 20 years, this is the way you will get your degree. Even in something like the MD. We firmly believe that the value proposition is just better for the student. Right. And explain why you think that. You’re making this bold prediction that nobody will go to Harvard. Well, if you can get everything that you would have gotten in the campus program, including the affiliation with the school, which is something I feel like gets left out a lot ... Sure, “I went to Georgetown.” “I went to ...” Well, more than that. I’m a Tarheel. I didn’t just go to the school. An example of something we do in these programs is we do these immersions, where students go physically. Which is a good idea. Well, we thought it was really a bad idea in the beginning. And Chapel Hill was like, “Nope, we’re gonna do it.” And we were like, “You can’t do that, you’re taking away the one thing that we’re selling, which is that you don’t have to go.” Right. We were totally wrong. Just for a short time. And they were so popular that they had to increase the number that they would allow students to take for credit. Like for a weekend. So you show up and there are 500 students dipped in their Carolina blue, going to the Dean Dome to have that shared experience. Right. Or being on campus with the Old Well. And then there was another one, there was another university in San Francisco, and I’m blanking because I’ve written about it before, where they’re a smaller university. University’s created from nothing. Minerva? Minerva, yeah. That’s another friend of mine, Ben Nelson, the entrepreneur. Yeah. That’s a different way. That’s going there. No. Well, part of it. It’s blended. And you can argue everything I do is blended, because you’re putting somebody in to do their clinical. But there’s a couple Minerva-like programs. There are. There has not been — college replacement, which is what you’re talking about now. Yes. You can’t really name one that’s really worked. Yes. Because it’s a degree from Minerva, right? It’s hard. It’s a long putt. Now, to give them credit, what I love about ... No, they’re very good professors, it’s very interesting. But what’s interesting there is that they’re trying to go after a big idea. Yes. And I feel like ed tech’s been plagued by too many people doing small things. Right. You need some big, bold ideas. All right. So the idea is that you get your degree. So what happens to colleges? Because one of the issues I know with colleges, it’s increasingly hard to get into colleges, and yet a lot ... It’s only a small group of them it’s increasingly hard to get in. And then there’s a vast amount of universities and colleges that have a hard time attracting students. Yeah. So I personally believe that those, the latter part, is over-reported, and if you look at the top 500 schools, generally speaking, tons of demand for the undergrad level. You and I are sitting here saying we couldn’t get into Georgetown or GW today. Schools that weren’t aspirational when I was growing up are now completely aspirational. There’s so much worldwide demand for those schools. Now, if you’re a small, unbranded private liberal arts college somewhere in the country that no one’s ever heard of, you can’t be charging the kind of prices you are and have that be sustainable. Right. One of the things we feel like we’re bringing to the table is, sustainability as part of the ecosystem’s important. My company’s doing well, the university’s doing well. Why? Student wins, university wins, I win. It’s pretty simple. So if the student doesn’t win, nobody wins. But I also have to make sure that the university has a strong, sustainable operation going. So from a cost standpoint, we actually do think that long term we can have a really significant impact both on the overall student cost and on the actual cost of tuition. So why at all have the gathering places of universities? Do you feel like it’s gonna just not have them? There’s gonna be a Harvard, right? Yeah no, actually, I believe the campus programs will continue to exist for a really long time. One of the things that’s tricky about it is, the world can’t pick up their life and go to Stanford. That’s not most people’s experience. Most people, most of undergrad to be clear, is not the person going to Georgetown or the person going to Stanford. So over time, how do we serve that population? Right. And serve them with something that’s ... But you only do graduate programs. Today. Today, right. Yeah. We’ve got some cooking. Although there is the experience part of it that people want. There is. But we do believe that there’s a way to accomplish that in the same way that we’ve done some of the graduate programs. So doing graduate is only because those are people in the working ... and they want to do, they would do say a Wharton executive program, or things like that. Yeah. The Wharton executive program is one way to think about it. Our Berkeley data science program or our Harvard business analytics program, those are all really good. But there’s also a huge shortage of speech pathologists in the world. When my youngest ... So you could start targeting those. We do today. So we do speech pathology, we do physical therapy, we do occupational therapy, we do social work. We do public health. Those are all really attractive. We’re gonna talk about the tech about that, deciding what jobs should be done. Because you could often go, “You don’t want to do that degree, you don’t want to go over here. Here’s where jobs are.” We try to focus only on those, as a company we have choices as to where we can put our capital. So we try to put our capital in places where ... The jobs. So you’ll have good outcomes. That’s right. Talk about the technology of where we’re going with this. Right now it’s on computers, right? People look at it on computers, or … ? It’s almost entirely mobile at this point. Mobile. Oh, they just go on their phones? Yeah. Well, their phones, their iPads. iPads, yeah. So, mobile’s huge, because we have a mobile workforce, so ... Right. They’re sitting in the park, taking ... Now, we did a really interesting deal with — you might have seen something about it — with WeWork where every student in every 2U-backed program can go to any WeWork on the planet at no cost. Sort of breakthrough opportunity ... It’s a place to go and do their lessons and stuff like that, and sitting there. So the tech, you know, it is mostly mobile at this point, now you of course can do it on your laptop. Is it more on iPads or phones? Quite a bit of both. Phone’s getting pretty big. Yeah, I guess you’re right. With this new giant iPhone coming ... The live classes aren’t as good on the phone — you know, those little tiny people — but on the iPad, it’s great. iPad, it’s great. Or they can do it on a computer? They can do it on computer. Where is that going? Where are we with VR for you, for example? It’s tough. The number of VR startups in education that are dead now... Education is not the place where you can reach the mass consumer that you need to popularize it. It makes total sense, doesn’t it? It makes sense for things like ... Classes. Well, our physician assistant program, which was the first-ever online physician assistant program, it was with Yale. So we built a cadaver unit, so I could tell you all kinds of things about cadavers, we had to deal with cadavers. My brother’s a doctor, he used to send me pictures of it. He shouldn’t have done that, but he did. Well, the cadaver unit, you would wanna see. No. I did, I saw too many. But so the important thing is creating that unit. That’s something that over time we do believe new technology will make it better and better and better. Right. That’s in order to see it and feel like you’re there? Yeah, but today, the reality is, having great instruction and having great faculty, and going physically and doing it is a big part of what we do. So we just passed 43,000 clinical placements, just to give you an idea of the scale. Okay. This is anywhere? You could put them in any hospital near where they are. We’ve done it in, now, 37,000 different clinics. So literally everywhere. Where they go to do their different thing, whether a midwife or speech therapist? Now you know what’s cool about that? What? What’s cool about that is, think about the impact on the local community when they graduate. Right, that they will have a job. They’ve worked there and stuff like that. That’s the key. I want to get back to VR and haptics and things like that. There’s obviously all that going on. How far away is that? I think for education, today, it’s not a viable use case. Now, a company like 2U, as we get more successful, will be able to invest before others will. But I would say, it’s not like VR today has been wildly successful for anybody, and you’re not gonna see a hugely successful education use case to start it. That’s right, exactly, it’ll be porn. I just took a VR roller coaster ride. It was in a roller coaster and you wore VR, so you were physically riding a roller coaster. Right, it was moving up and down. That was cool. That is cool. I liked it. Was that at Recode? I didn’t see that. No, it was in Hong Kong, I was in Hong Kong with my son, and I was forced to go to a theme park. But it was interesting, it was interesting. I’m more interested in VR than other people are. I just played a game, those things that are in malls now. They’re quite fun. Yep. You mean like you sit in the thing? I’m the only person who likes VR, really. And I used to hate it, now I love it. Yeah. I think it’s a pretty long putt for education right now. Another long putt, all right, you’re making golf references everywhere we go. I’m not even a golfer. Don’t birdie at me. Okay, so what technologies, it’s just mobile, mobile, right? Mobile, mobile, mobile. Live, and a single 2U course has more video content than a season of “Game of Thrones.” So, you’re talking about a lot of stuff. But not as many dismemberments. Not as many dismemberments. Although in the physician assistant program, there’s quite a few dismemberments. I interviewed the little guy that wrote everything. J.J., whatever. The guy who wrote “Game of Thrones,” the actual author. He has like 10 letters in his name, whatever, him. I read the first one, then I punted. He was fascinating, he looks like just the nicest little man you’d ever wanna meet. My first question was like, “What is going on in your sick head that you make up all of this?” That’s some crazy stuff. Oh, it’s crazy. You know what I mean? This guy looks like your grandfather, and suddenly ... It’s crazy, and we’ll eventually see the end of it in another seven years. Allegedly. So you don’t see any technologies being something that would replace ... No, definitively, over time, like VR, AR, you will have an impact, particularly in the physical disciplines. But really right now, I’ll give you an interesting lesson from even with our current technology, there’s one particular professor in the Chapel Hill program that we really kept trying to push to do some of the newer things and he kept sort of insisting on wanting to do it the way that he’s comfortable. So we end up filming him and letting him do his thing. Even though it has fewer bells and whistles, it’s the second-highest rated course. Why? Because he’s brilliant. What did you try to make him do? We do a lot of tech-enabled video. So you’re in front of a lightboard, so they’re drawing on it and they’re illustrating a lot of things. That was an accounting course, in the accounting course, that’s super useful, because you’re moving stuff between T accounts. And he really wanted to do it sort of ... The old-fashioned way. The thing about the old-fashioned way, you’re still opening the old-fashioned way to a ton of people that could never experience it. So that’s hugely powerful. But you know, he’s just an incredible lecturer and it really worked well, so it’s very highly-rated. All right, last couple of questions. Where are these students from? All over. The world? The world. Mostly the U.S.? Mostly the U.S. So the interesting thing, when I tell you why should you pick up your life, quit your job and move to attend … A lesson learned of 2U from our early days. We spent a lot of capital doing international marketing for our schools. The value prop for an international student is not quite as aligned. Why? Because you kind of want to come here. If you can afford it, you can get in and you can speak enough English, you typically want to come here for some time period. Now, we bought a company last year in Cape Town, South Africa, so we now have 500 employees in Cape Town, South Africa, that offered something like 2U, but instead of for a degree, it’s for a short course. And at Code, Eric Rosenbach taught one of the courses at Harvard on cybersecurity. It made me particularly proud when you got onstage and said, “That was one of the coolest presentations we’ve seen.” It was, yeah. So the short course, you’re talking about skills attainment for truly a worldwide audience. Sort of stand out from the crowd, get a certificate. Shorter ones. Yeah, six to eight weeks, and an example of a course would be the Harvard cybersecurity course, or Oxford blockchain or MIT Internet of Things. Like skills attainment courses for the sort of corporate employee, or the lifelong learner. That is a true worldwide audience. I did one of those. I actually took a train up to Philadelphia, when I worked at the Washington Post, an accounting course. It helped me catch a lot of terrible internet companies. Well, if you want to take our blockchain course, I’ll get it for you. Not today. But maybe. Not today. I don’t like school, I never did. I kind of like it. I got the heebie jeebies when I was over at Georgetown, because I was just like, “Oh, God, here.” I mean, I like it enough. If you think about it, it’s kind of nuts that I actually did the MBA, and I got a lot out of it, I’ll tell you. Even though we were public through most of it. I would take a poetry course, that’s what I would take. So we’ve talked a lot about creative writing, and haven’t done it because we worry that even though there’s demand for it, we’re worried that somebody ... That it won’t place. Well, they won’t get a job anyway, so it doesn’t matter. They won’t get a job doing that. So we’re worried, even though there’s a lot of people that really want it. So is it mostly stuff that just is job focused? Yeah, more job focused than not. What’s the most unusual course you have? The physician assistant program is pretty groundbreaking. You wouldn’t think of Speech Pathology or the Doctorate of Physical Therapy. That one’s pretty interesting for an online program. Our Data Science program at Berkeley was literally the first of its kind, no one had ever done Data Science. And that particular dean, she’s incredible, she basically pounded me to do it. We didn’t want to do it at first. This was way before data was hot. She insisted we do it and we eventually listened to her. Now, that’s super obvious that that was a huge win. So to finish up, I want to talk about the broader aspect, finishing up. When you think about online education, what do you think the impact will have? Is it that more people are educated, or that people will go to colleges? You may not have seen this, but something fascinating just happened, where Purdue University acquired ... That’s in Ohio? This is in Ohio, right? Where’s Purdue? Indiana. Indiana, sorry. Purdue acquired Kaplan University, the for-profit, and turned it into Purdue Global. It’s sort of a notable moment, because you have a major state flagship embracing what would have been, and still is somewhat, controversial. Ten years ago, Kaplan was pretty controversial, but Kaplan is trying to educate a much broader ... It used to be owned by the Washington Post, Kaplan was. I know. They did mostly SAT, right? Well Kaplan, way back, was test prep, and then over time got into becoming a for-profit university. So what I think is fascinating, having a state flagship purchase a former for-profit and offer that kind of programming more broadly, tells you where the world is going. And does that impact your business? Eventually, you think about a lot of internet things, before it was done by a lot of people and everyone just had it in-house. I would say, in general, we believe that that’s more good for our business than bad. It puts a lot of wind at our back as online ed gets more accepted. Once again, online education, people don’t think is any good. Over time, as it becomes more obvious to people, it’ll make our job marketing for our university partners easier. There will be some competition, but the market is so big. I feel like where 2U is right now is where Amazon was in the stage when they were adding the tabs. Oh, by the way, Amazon’s getting into this business. I’m kidding. No, they will, what are you talking about? Amazon will get into every business. But from the standpoint of our overall ... They would get into this business, wouldn’t they? Sure, of course. Well, they already do internal corporate training. That’ll be where they start. Right. Apple’s kind of in it, not really, it’s just university courses. I think people want to receive their certification and their degree from Berkeley. No, I get that, but you can see Apple, I mean, Apple’s had a history in this space but haven’t doubled down on it. They had Apple University. Right, they’d have to figure out how to have all of the clinical apparatus and all of the other components. Do you see those big ones getting in there, or buying their way in? We do think it’s interesting that tech is waking up to ed tech. No question. So the Lynda purchase by LinkedIn, which obviously is now part of Microsoft, notable. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. All right, Chip, last question. What’s the next course you’re taking? What are you getting a degree in? Nursing? So I think my team and my wife and my family would kill me if I took a doctorate, but that would obviously be the next step for me. A doctorate? Well, I did the MBA, so now I’ve got an advanced degree. Okay. Do you need to be called Doctor, do I have to call you Dr. Chip? You can call me Dr. Chip. Dr. Chip. Dr. Chip. That’s good. No, I will not. Why not? I will not do it. I will not do it. Anyway, this was great talking to you. It’s a really interesting discussion on where it’s going, because you’re right, it has changed so substantively in terms from the beginning. But it’s really important. Yeah, people don’t do it and think of it the way they should. I’m just thinking of my kids going to college and I’m thinking in a traditional way. I’m thinking my kid’s not going to college now, he’s just gonna do an online college. They will, no, no, no, they will. But it’s interesting, as our company becomes more notable, so Valerie Jarrett joined our board. When she did, she said, “You haven’t heard of this company, but you soon will.” I mean, we feel like we’re starting to resonate. Valerie’s smart. We’re starting to resonate, you know? Yeah. And I guess I would argue that it’s early days, but it’s a huge opportunity. Because we just need more access to this kind of stuff, not less. Great. Thank you so much. It’s great talking to you. Thank you. ",https://www.recode.net/2018/10/14/17974262/chip-paucek-2u-online-college-graduate-education-kara-swisher-decode-podcast,recode,_keyword,NULL,2018-10-14T16:00:02
"When big companies are hacked, should they have to disclose it immediately?"," Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway mull the week in digital insecurity on the latest episode of Pivot. “It’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up.” That old truism from the Watergate affair also applies to the scandals plaguing some of the world’s biggest tech companies, says NYU professor Scott Galloway. On the latest episode of Pivot, he and Recode’s Kara Swisher talked about the Google+ hack that the company sat on for months and did not disclose until the Wall Street Journal came knocking. “This is probably why [Google] didn’t show up for the Senate hearings,” Galloway said. “What if someone had said to them, ‘Are you aware of any hacks?’ Do they perjure themselves, or do they release that data in front of Congress, in front of national TV?” Swisher said the incident makes the internet bill of rights drafted by Democrats in Congress even more relevant. One of the proposed rights that Rep. Ro Khanna discussed on a recent episode of Recode Decode is the right of consumers to be notified in a timely fashion in the event of a security breach. “Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s not used that much,’” she said of Google+, which the company now plans to shut down. “But 500,000 people ... Google not protecting your data, really, is the point. And then not telling you about these breaches to me is again the same problem, that there is not a federal law that requires immediate disclosure of these hacks.” You can listen to Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway wherever you get your podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a full transcript of Kara and Scott’s latest episode. Kara Swisher: Hi everyone, this is Pivot from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I’m Kara Swisher, founder of Recode. Scott Galloway: And I’m Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU. Today, Kara, I’m bringing you Jared Kushner-like “hidden genius,” so get ready. You’re in Florida today, is that right? How’s the weather? You’re expecting a storm, right? Yeah. Fortunately, we’re on the east coast so it’s not a big deal. But obviously, our good wishes go out to the folks in the Panhandle. Absolutely, absolutely. It got a little scarier than we thought. This is part ... You know, it was interesting because there was a climate change report that President Trump completely ignored this week, but it seems like this is what it’s been predicting, these kind of massive storms just happening one after the next. And it’s always the stuff you’re not expecting, right? Right. I mean, the last thing got a ton of hype, nothing, and then this just kinda snuck up on us. Well, it only takes one, Scott, in these storms. I don’t mind if it gets hype and is a letdown. But in any case, there’s been a lot of storms across the tech and media landscape this week. I hate to make a horrible metaphor thing, but there’s been a lot going on. It’s been another bad week for tech, which is really kind of fascinating that it just ... You can’t cut a break on anything, but it doesn’t also deserve a break. The Google Hack The first one, obviously, is the Google data breach of Google Plus. It feels like every week these days there’s a story about a data breach; last week Facebook was under fire, and continues to be under fire, and this week it’s Google. So what do you think about this? Google Plus, half a million people got their data hacked. And by the way, Kara, remember how awesome Google Plus used to be? No, I do not. Yeah, neither does anyone else. Right, right. That’s my big joke. Right, okay. So like most scandal, it’s not the crime, it’s the cover-up. Because when you think about 500,000 people, that is literally amateur hour in the world of Facebook; add a couple zeroes and you’re talking about the Facebook hack, so it’s not the hack itself. The strange thing here is that six months ago — it happened six months ago — and this is probably why they didn’t show up for the senate hearings, because ... Oh really? Yeah, because they didn’t want to talk about it. Well, think about it: What if someone had said to them, “Are you aware of any hacks?” Do they perjure themselves, or do they release that data in front of Congress, in front of national TV? So I don’t ... And a decent question for you or anyone else in the media that talks to these guys is, the next time they speak to anyone from Google, to ask them, “Are there any hacks you know about that we don’t?” Right, exactly. You know, people have been sort of making a joke about Google Plus; nobody used it, and by the way, nobody used it. You know, Google’s been trying very hard to get into the social space for many years a couple years ago, and they were essentially creating a social network for antisocial people and by antisocial people. And they weren’t successful. They tried Orkut first, if you remember Orkut, which was a guy who worked for Google, and it was popular in Brazil for a millisecond, and it may still be. And then Google Plus, which was run by someone named Vic Gundotra, and again it didn’t work at all and it couldn’t keep up with Facebook; they sort of had Facebook envy. And then nobody used it because it was just a terrible social network. It had circles that I never understood. If you recall, it was all these weird circles and different weird things like that, because of Google, I guess, with the Os. But what was really fascinating about it is everyone’s like, “Oh, it’s not used that much,” but 500,000 people still ... Google not protecting your data, really, is the point. And then not telling you about these breaches to me is again the same problem, that there is not a federal law that requires immediate disclosure of these hacks, which I think was among the Internet Bill of Rights that I wrote about last week in the Times. That they have to immediately disclose these things, they have to be required by law to do so. And it looks as if we’re headed that way, right? What’s your sense of this regulation in California? What have you heard? I read somewhere that Representative Khanna actually showed you a draft of the legislation. He did, he did. It’s not legislation, it’s an Internet Bill of Rights, and then you make and craft your legislation out of it. You know, there’s all kinds of ... It’s a whole grab bag of things from net neutrality to privacy to data protection to ... All kinds of things. And one of the Bill of Rights, I think it was number seven or eight, was the idea that you have to immediately disclose these hacks. And that could be legislation by itself; it’s not gonna be one big giant legislative mass, it’s going to be a series of them. And I talked to Nancy Pelosi, who would be the Speaker of the House if the Democrats won ... But of course, they may not have the Senate, so this may go nowhere. But she was talking about the fact that they were going to craft some sort of legislation. Until then, California and Europe are the places where this is happening. California’s been super aggressive and has passed a privacy bill, it’s passed a diversity on boards bill, net neutrality. So this is gonna be a really interesting time to see what states are gonna probably put into place things to control these companies. Do you worry, Kara, that inadvertently this legislation or this type of regulation might in fact end up emboldening or empowering the companies it’s meant to curb? That really it hurts the middle guy? Yeah, it does. ... the mid-sized company that doesn’t have an estimated budget ... A lawyer. ... of six or eight billion dollars to comply with this stuff? Yes, I do. That’s one of the big things. That’s one of the arguments of the big companies: “Don’t do it because we have lawyers.” I don’t know if that’s the ... You know, I think it’s gotta be crafted in such a way to protect smaller companies. And that’s definitely the case, they don’t have the ability. Like at GD[PR] … you know, all the stuff in Europe. It’s problematic for small companies, so it would hinder innovation. And the argument from these big companies is this is gonna hit ... You know, China doesn’t have to deal with these things. Well, China’s run by a president for life, so I guess it doesn’t. Like Facebook? Yeah, exactly. Oh my God. Scott, you were waiting for that one. By the way, we’ll have Xi for 20 years because of biology; we’re gonna have the Zuck for 70 years. You’re right. That’s a fair point. All right, in any case, they’ve gotta do something about this and there’s gotta be real payment for what’s going on here. It’s going back to the Yahoo thing, the Equifax thing; it’s just, you put your data online at great risk, and these companies are making billions of dollars off you, and they’re not protecting your privacy, and that’s just pretty much the situation going on. What was also interesting is you see big tech is now actually warming to the idea of federal regulation because of the transaction costs of dealing with a bunch of statewide regulations. Yeah, yeah. And then they can water it down because, you know, people in Washington. But you know, Mark Warner has issued some very strong statements. We’ll see where it goes. Facebook Portal And speaking of privacy, the Facebook Portal this week! Another product that is gonna sort of be like Google Plus to me. Joining the Portal game, which is a word we don’t use anymore ... It used to be Yahoo was a portal, and Excite was a portal, and stuff like that, and they’re re-taking this word up, Portal. And now they’re creating this device, and it has Amazon in it. What do you think of this? Are you buying one? I thought this was fascinating because, you know, “I want a camera in my house controlled by Facebook,” said no one ever. And actually, if you’ve looked at the product feedback, I think the product development folks at Facebook did a great job. My gut here is that it’s a great product. I don’t know if you’ve seen some of the automatic framing it does. I have. The notion, and it’s a genius notion, of not having a video conference with someone but feeling as if you’re in the room with them. Even little things like syncing music on both ends so you can enjoy music together. I think this is a great product, but here’s the problem: It’s from Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah. And the most telling thing about this product is it has a plastic lens cap. There are 150 million iPhones sold every year, no one’s demanded a plastic lens cap on that. There are 15 million cars sold each year and most of them have a camera in the rear license plate; no one’s demanded a plastic lens cap there. But Facebook comes out with something and ... It knows. ... basically the product development people said, “You know what, nobody trusts you. You’ve gotta make it really obvious that people can protect themselves.” Well, Mark has one on his camera at work. I took a picture once ... A piece of tape. Yes, a piece of tape. Yeah, and he has it there. He also has it over the speaker too, so he’s well aware of privacy issues, which is interesting, and I’ve talked to him about it before. Because I have one on my computer, too. I don’t have one on my phone, I probably should. It’s a really interesting question because I think you’re right, it’s a beautiful product, but there’s a lot of issues. I’ve seen reviews back and forth in that it’s sort of old school where you stay in a kitchen and stay there while you’re talking to people, and that’s not really a use case, necessarily. So I think that’ll matter more than anything else, if people really want to sit in their kitchen and talk to people, or be present. Telepresence, which has been bandied about by Silicon Valley ... Cisco had a telepresence thing, everyone’s tried this idea of the telepresence, and eventually it’s a great idea where it’ll seem like your parents are there, or your cousin, whoever you want to talk to, are right there when you’re talking to them. And that’ll be interesting someday, and this is a step towards it, but I just don’t see ... It’s sort of like the Facebook phone, if you recall the Facebook phone; again, nobody wanted it ever. Why do you have to have a Facebook phone versus just a phone that has Facebook on it? So I think it’s an interesting thing, but it’s not ... I can’t imagine it’s going to take off in any way whatsoever. Kind of like the HP iPod. Do you remember that? I did not know there was a ... I know that there was a Zune. I remember the Zune. The Zune was different. That was a really awful device by Microsoft trying to copy the iPod. But there was an HP version, a branded version, of the iPod. And Carly Fiorina, who was the CEO at the time, touted it as “innovation at HP,” and I was like, “You just colored an iPod red with HP on it.” It was just odd. So I don’t know. I just don’t think this is a product anybody’s waiting for, and especially right now where we don’t feel like Facebook has our privacy back in any way, that we want any device of theirs in the house. I don’t want the Amazon one in the house; I don’t want the Google one in the house at this point. Oh, the Amazon one is awesome. It is awesome. I have it, I have it. I just turn it off all the time. It’s incredible. I just turn it off all the time. It is, it is. A couple really interesting things that’ll happen here, or won’t happen: One is, if this thing gets any traction, then all the barking at the moon that we do, all the headline news about our concerns, are overblown. It’s not gonna get traction. I’m gonna go out there with that: It’s not gonna get traction. Fair enough. But if it does, it means all of this privacy concern that we’re upset about hasn’t gained traction in the consumer community. I think you’re wrong. I think people are very aware of it. Regular people talk to me about it every day; like they understand. You speak to regular people? I talk to regular people all the time. They get it. And the other thing is, what I was really hoping would happen today is I was hoping Amazon would take a page out of Facebook in terms of what they’ve done to Snap and announce the exact same features in the next Amazon Show. Oh, that would be funny. Right? Just say, “Okay, we’re learning from you, Facebook.” But the Echo, it’s in there. Amazon’s Alexa is in there. You’re not buying it, the Portal. Right? Correct? Oh, no. I hate Facebook. I mean, I’m even ... I think anyone that’s suffered ... anyone that ... That’s a no. That’s a hard no then. Other than ruining America, I’m onboard with the company. Yeah. Okay. Hard no. Hard no. I hope this is a big thud. Yeah. Okay. Good. Okay. Good then. Okay. Well, good wishes towards you, Mark Zuckerberg. Wins of the Week: Taylor Swift and Nikki Haley Okay. Wins of the week. There’s so many to think about. I am going to go first. I am going to go first on this one, on wins of the week, is Taylor Swift. I love Taylor Swift. I’m not going to pretend I don’t like Taylor Swift. I’m not going to say, “Oh, she’s annoying, but I sometimes ...” I love Taylor Swift. Everything about her cracks me up. And this week, she went, Instagrammed, that millennials should vote. And she was saying she backed the Democratic candidate in Tennessee, where she’s from. And all of a sudden, everyone signed up to vote, which I thought was fantastic. And so I’m really interested in this sort of Kanye-Taylor fight, again because Kanye’s on the Trump side and Taylor now is on the other. So it’s the Tay-ye, whatever, ye, whatever fight. And I really like that she did this. Yeah. It’s nice. I like that she used her power for good, in this case. Have you been to a Taylor Swift concert? No, I ... yes, I have. That’s not true. I have seen her sing when I was in an iHeartRadio thing, and she was absolutely fantastic. She’s a great performer. Yeah. In a word, awesome. And not only that, it’s a concert you can take your kids to. Well, my favorite part of the whole concert was when she finished her song, and then she took this long bow, and then they weren’t clapping enough. And she put her hands up. She’s like, “More clapping, please.” And everyone did. They went crazy. And I loved her for that. I thought, “Oh, man. I love this woman. She’s great.” Yeah, that’s nice. That’s nice. So it was interesting to use the power of digital to do this. And not many people can do this, but she certainly, obviously, showed that she could. Yeah. And supposedly voter registration is up, so it’s having an impact. Yeah. Well, we’ll see where it goes, but it’s interesting that she’s done it. A lot of these celebrities are stepping out politically, much more. Everybody is, in that regard. What is your win of the week? Oh, hands down, biggest winner of the week, hands down, and probably of the month, Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley? Why? Why? Tell me. Oh, my gosh. She’s getting out of Dodge with her reputation intact. I mean, working in the Trump administration means A) you’re likely going to jail, or B) your reputation is going to be severely tarnished. She comes out, she exits the administration with probably the best brand in politics. In my opinion, if you were to bet on anybody who will likely be president at some point, it’s probably her. Why is that? That’s a prediction, along with your win of the week. Why so? Why so? She’s the perfect blend of kind of gangster strong, communicates leadership, strength, and I think that brand, mixed with the Republican ideology in a cocktail, is a pretty good mix. I think she’s a player and a comer. Yeah, Nikki Haley. Oh, really? Interesting. Interesting. See, I heard different things back and forth all week, whether she was really good at politics. She did sort of effusively compliment him on the way up, but then someone else who’s here in Washington told me that what she’s going to do then is take potshots from the sidelines. So now she has permission to take sort of ... on certain issues around women and other issues that would be strong for her. I think it gives her permission to run in 2020 if things really come off the rails. Oh, really? Do you think they will? Are you still on that game? I don’t think so. Well, they are. Really? I don’t know. I think they are. I don’t know. Analytical. These people, they seem to survive. Anand Giridharadas and the problem with elites So speaking of being a total kiss-ass, you know what the best thing I read this week was? What? The writeup of your interview with Anand — and I’m going to massacre his name — the author, talking about ... Yes, Anand. Yes. Yes. About elites. Oh, my gosh. I thought that was fantastic. Thank you. Just the notion ... this guy is my new hero. The notion that we — basically TED and Davos and the Aspen Institute — invite all these “arsonists,” all these people who created these problems because they’re the ones that can fix them. And that these people need ... these individuals, mostly tech billionaires, need to be more reflective about not only enjoying questions about what can they do moving forward, but how did we get here and what was their role in that. I thought this guy, he is ... Right. Right. He compared it to a crime scene, which I thought was really fantastic. They want to pretend that a crime didn’t take place, and they wouldn’t ... Yeah. They show up and say, “Well, what’s happened here has happened. Let’s put this behind us and let’s move on. Let’s talk about making sure this doesn’t happen again.” One of the things that I ... what I’m thinking about is that they’re also victim-y. I’ve recently been pretty tough on them, and they’re like, “You’re so mean.” And I’m like, “You’re like a bunch of sore winners.” It reminds me of the Trump ... the Trump people won Kavanaugh, and then they had to be mean. I was like, “Sore winners, once again.” And I think tech people are the same way. They’ve won on every account, and then when you call them to task for a couple things, as Anand did, they get all tetchy. “Well, we’ll take our money and go.” Or, “Don’t you appreciate us?” ”We’re done. We’re done.” Yeah, which is like, “No. We really don’t appreciate you.” But I agree. It’s a great book. It’s about elites, and it’s well worth listening to the podcast, but it’s also well worth buying the book. And we’ll see where we go from there, if they listen to what he has to say. That’ll happen. Yeah. They will. They might. I’m sure it’s a moment of reflection. Yeah. They get testy. I am on the receiving end of testy phone calls from tech people all week long for some reason, like, “Oh, you’ve been very grumpy.” What’s been the worst one? What’s been the ... take angry times famous, who wins? They’re just so whiny. I just don’t ... “You’re so mean. Don’t be so hard on us.” And I’m like, “You know what? I’m gonna. I’m just not going to stop, you...” The message they should have gotten is, “We have to fix something.” And the message they’ve gotten is, “Poor little me.” And I’m not clear why that’s the case. What Anand was talking about is, “Let’s be reflective of our impact and figure out ways that maybe you should listen to people more.” And instead it’s, “Well, we’re trying to help,” that kind of thing. It’s just ... what’s the ... they’re just all ... I just can’t ... I’m so now over it. I just can’t even ... I just can’t ... I can’t ... I just hang up. I just hang up. That’s what I do. I just hang up now. You’re done. I’m done. Do you really hang up on those guys? I’m calling around a lot because of this murder of the Saudi journalist by the Saudis, it looks like. And according to some of the investigation, some of the reporting, this Washington Post columnist, and there’s a lot of money from Saudi Arabia within ... from Saudi Arabia in Silicon Valley. It’s like awash in Saudi money. And I’m trying to get any of them to say anything, and they’re like, “Well, we really can’t say anything.” And I’m like, “You’ve got to be kidding.” And now I realize, they don’t care. They don’t care. They just take the money, and that this regime is possibly doing this doesn’t seem ... I can’t get anyone to comment, let’s just say. I can’t get anyone to comment. And what would you have them do? Comment. “This is terrible. And if they did this, we have to think hard about the investments these people are making.” Something. Anything. Anything that’s human. So anything human would be nice. A pulse? Something? A pulse. Anyway, on that horrible note, we’re going to take one more quick break, and we’ll be right back with some predictions. Predictions: Sniper retail acquisitions and techlash Welcome back to Pivot with Scott Galloway and myself, Kara Swisher. So predictions, predictions, Scott. You have to have some. We have to have some every week, and you have to be right. There you go. And by the way, I’ve been remarkably ... You weren’t right about the Facebook stock again, by the way. Oh, my God. I’ve been remarkably wrong about that. I said that Amazon ... Wrong. All of tech stocks are getting hit. Yeah. I said Amazon was going to pass Apple. I’ve just been hugely wrong. So my predictions ... All right. Try again. Yeah. Trying to get back in your good graces. I think that some of these sniper retail concepts are going to be acquired in the short term. Explain that. Explain that. Well, there’s a couple trends in retail. One is sort of this Ritalin retail, these Pop-Up Museums, the Frosé Mansion, the Museum of Pizza, which really play on this trend in retail of scarcity. And it’s not that these museums are great. It’s that, one, they offer a giant Instagram moment, and two, you know they’re going away in 90 days, so everybody should go. Oh, wow. And I think that’s largely indicative of sort of this Ritalin generation, and where retail needs to head, fast-fashion creating a sense of retail. The other kind of trend in retail is sniper retail, where you find a category where they’re fat and happy and incumbent, whether it’s Bausch &amp; Lomb, or Labelux with Warby Parker, or the mattress industry, which was literally asleep, so to speak, and you have Casper, and then the luggage industry, which basically had Samsonite, and Tumi, and maybe Rimowa, and went Away. So my prediction is that Casper and/or Away gets acquired in the next three to six months. That’s interesting. By whom? There’s already been some reports that Walmart is sniffing around. Walmart has figured out that the way to kind of push back on big tech is to grab the mic back, and one of the best press releases that sort of says, “We get it,” is these acquisitions, whether it’s Jet or Bonobos. And I said that I thought Jet was a ridiculous acquisition at three and a half billion dollars, but the reality was it gave them the opportunity to say that their e-commerce was growing 40 to 60 percent year on year for four quarters in a row. So if they can pick these things up as maybe ... Amazon announced they were getting the mattresses, which means Casper’s value got cut in half the next day, in the same fashion that any industry’s value gets cut anywhere between 10 and 40 percent when Amazon just hints that they’re going into it. Right. I think Casper actually is probably a little more open to being acquired right now. I think that would be the smartest thing they could do. And there’s a couple of ... There’s Purple, there’s Casper, there’s a whole bunch of them in this industry. Thread and Needle. Thread and — Tuft and Needle. It’s just incredible. Tough to name all of them, yeah. They’re all very interesting because I have to say, it is a terrible experience, mattress buying, and they did change it. The question is, can they operate on their own or do they have to be part of a bigger organization? It’s interesting, because I had dinner recently with the CEO of Walmart, and he’s quite aware of his need to do this. He’s quite aware of the importance and trying to figure out how they can compete, which is kind of odd to think about Walmart being on the back foot on anything, but they are, for sure. That is an excellent prediction. I like that prediction. I think that’s a really good one. Yeah, you’re into that? I like that one. Thanks so much. I think you’re right. I think you’re right. Well, it’s like Eisenhower said, it’s not ... plans are worthless, but planning is invaluable. I think predicting ... or predictions are worthless, but predicting is a lot of fun. I have a question for you in a prediction. Which of the big tech companies a year on from now has ... looking back, has gotten beaten up the worst? Oh, Facebook. Facebook? Yeah. Both in terms of usage, not only regulation, but in terms of the actual underlying performance of the company, you think this is starting to seep into the company? I think so. I think so. I think they’re really ... Yeah, I do. I think a lot of people ... They’ve shown blood, I guess. Do you know what I mean? They’re still enormous and they’re still growing like crazy, but there’s something off. I think probably Facebook. Yeah. Google just has now finally been drawn into this and it hadn’t been before, but between China and this breach, they had sort of skulked away from some of the responsibility here and I think they’re ... but the two of them, I think. I think Apple is just fine. It’s just a question of creating great products or continuing to create great products there. They certainly got dinged in this hacking thing, but they fought back pretty hard and so did Amazon against this Bloomberg story about there being an errant chip in there, in the boards that are having to do with their technology. That was scary. That was. If true. It’s not ... they’ve been pretty adamant that it’s not true, so that’s an interesting thing developing. We’ll see where Apple goes from there on that issue. Would Apple or Google buy Tesla? So not a prediction, but a thesis and I want you to respond. All right. The lack of self control, the id on steroids, the weak board that is Tesla. Stock gets cut in half from here, which I think makes it, I don’t know, 20 or 30 billion market cap. Yeah. Apple steps in and buys it. I’m surprised somebody hasn’t stepped in. Apple steps in and buys it. Yeah. What do you think? No. No. No. Why? I don’t know, I just can’t see those guys ... I can see those guys getting in a room and going ... I know them pretty well, and being like, “No, we can’t.” What about Google? Get a jump on self-drive? Yeah, maybe, but again, it’s who’s gonna do it? Is it Sundar? They’ve got enough stuff going on that it’s sort of who ... sure. Sure, Google would be ... Apple and Google would be the purchasers, it’s just like, would you take that on right now? It’s a level of exhaustion, talk about execution. It’s a lot. It’s a lot, and the issue is can we do it ourselves, slower but better, kind of stuff? Maybe one of the big carmakers might ... that’s a lot of money for them. They can’t afford it. Yeah. They can’t afford it. That’s a lot of money. Because they’re valued like car companies, for some reason. Tesla isn’t. I would question ... I would wonder, what does it buy them? Besides a lot ... remember when everyone thought everyone was gonna buy Twitter? I kept saying, “No. It’s too much. There’s just too much hair on that dog,” kind of thing. And I think that’s the issue, is the level of ... I just don’t see it. I just don’t see it. But, you know, it’s a good idea. But it’s ... it’s also a lot of money. Could they get it that way elsewhere without that and just make Tesla one of these pioneers that either did or didn’t make it? Let it go. What does it buy you? It’s not a lot of money for Apple. If the stock gets cut in half, it’s at 20 billion, 50 percent premium, that’s a 3 percent dilution. I can’t think of one person who could run that there, and I can’t see him being comfortably within Apple. And they’re not that acquisitive. They’re not at all. They’re very controlled about what they do. They just ... I can see them just going ... I can see Tim going, “No.” I just see it. You know what I mean? “No. Let’s just focus over here,” kind of thing. And I think they pulled back a little bit in their car stuff. Google has ... Google has let go a lot of really great people who worked there. They’ve let people come and go so I wonder where the commitment to cars ... it is but it ... you know what I mean? Who’s the driver of the commitment? Larry’s over making hovercrafts. Sergey, who knows where he is? You know what I mean? Sundar has got his hands full, so who? Who’s the person who’s gonna be that person? Diane Greene’s busy with the Cloud. Susan’s busy over at YouTube. I wonder who would be the executive. That’s all. I think about the people and I can’t think of any of them that would be any good at it. But maybe, who knows? Who knows? It’s just ... I don’t know. Someone’s gonna win here, it’s just a question of who it is and it’s gonna be a long time from now. Kavanaugh and Melania Trump Anyway, Scott, I think we’ve covered a lot today. Did we miss anything? I think that’s it. I think we covered ... What was your least favorite thing or the thing you hated most about the Kavanaugh hearings? Melania Trump and her appalling statement about hard evidence. I literally don’t even know what to say. Just when they were completely appalling, she drops the most appalling thing. I think I ... it seems like the Stockholm Syndrome has really taken effect with her rather significantly. And do you think Ivanka is gonna be the new ambassador to the UN? No. I do not. I think probably it’s gonna be Dina Powell, if she wants it. Yeah. Isn’t Ivanka just her father if he drank water and had a bigger wig? I’m not gonna comment on that. She’s not gonna be the UN ambassador. By the way, that is a line from my favorite comedian, Michelle Wolf, who is the next ex-Mrs. Galloway, she just doesn’t know it yet. Okay. All right. She is my hero. She is. She is incredible. Do you know her? I’ve never met her. I think she wants to ... I think she wants to know me. Okay. All right. I have that sense. We’ll find out. I saw her in a ... don’t try and segue. I’m gonna stop it. I’m gonna stop this right now, Scott. I was in Washington Square Park and I saw her with my boys, and I screamed, “You’re a genius,” and she literally ran from me. Oh really? Literally ran. That’s good. That is an excellent response by Michelle. So that means she has good judgment. She has good judgment. If I see her, I will tell her to stay away from you. Funny and good judgment. I’ll give her a little picture to hold and say, “This guy’s a stalker.” It will be good. It will be good. Wait. So my least favorite thing about the Kavanaugh hearings? What? Can I just tell you? Yes, go ahead. That’s what you wanted. You didn’t really want to know what I ... No, no, no. I listen to respond, not to learn, Kara. So, Susan Collins and this whole notion of presumption of innocence. Presumption of innocence is this really important construct used in courts of law for a thousand years and it’s used as a means to determine whether people get to join the three million people who are incarcerated. It’s not a construct of a job interview. Yep. Agree. My kids’ school is interviewing a headmaster, and the notion that we wouldn’t pick somebody because, let’s say, “Well, we have to assume anything bad about him is not true unless it’s proven,” where did the presumption of innocence come in when we’re trying to find out if someone should wear the most ... one of the nine most important robes in the world. Well, they turned it into a court of law, didn’t they? That’s what they’re doing. That term should have never been injected into this whole process. That’s because it’s easy to understand by regular people. Like, oh, guilty and ... Who you speak to. I do, all the time. Anyway, it was great talking to you. Stay safe in the hurricane. Thank you, Kara. Keep yourselves safe. Thanks very much.

Inequality in Silicon Valley is getting worse: Wages are down for everyone but the top 10 percent," In America’s tech capital, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. For nearly 20 years, Silicon Valley has led the nation in economic growth. But most of its workers have been excluded from reaping the rewards of this boom. Nine in 10 workers in the California region make less than they did in 1997 after adjusting for inflation, according to a new report. The study shows a pattern of income inequality on tech’s home turf that’s even worse than the national average. Authors of the report point to an increasing concentration of company profits going toward the salaries of a select few — largely, high-skilled tech workers. “I see this as a real warning sign,” said University of California Santa Cruz Professor Chris Benner, who published the study with worker advocacy group Working Partnerships USA. “Tech has been a tremendously successful business market, but we need business leaders to ensure that our workers are benefitting from economic growth.” Middle-class workers in Silicon Valley are being hit the hardest by stagnating wages, seeing their earnings go down by as much as 14 percent. For those at the lowest rung of the income ladder, incomes have gone down by about 1 percent. Unlike in Silicon Valley, nationally, median and very-low-income earners have still seen some wage growth, even as the rate of that growth has slowed down in comparison to high-income earners. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""O97eo""]={},window.datawrapper[""O97eo""].embedDeltas={""100"":617,""200"":475,""300"":450,""400"":425,""500"":425,""700"":400,""800"":400,""900"":400,""1000"":400},window.datawrapper[""O97eo""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-O97eo""),window.datawrapper[""O97eo""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""O97eo""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""O97eo""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""O97eo""==b)window.datawrapper[""O97eo""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); Meanwhile, tech workers in the Valley have seen their income go up across every bracket — with the highest gains in real wages at the 80th and 90th percentile of tech’s income earners, at around 38 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Specific reasons behind this deepening income inequality in Silicon Valley, according to the report, include: Tech companies are spending a large portion of their capital toward paying a limited number of research and development staff to design new products and software, but not toward maintenance and service staff like factory and maintenance workers — roles that are increasingly outsourced to third-party firms. A “winner-take-all market” for many tech companies. Increasingly, a few tech companies have been able to dominate as “winners” in their markets — such as Google in search or Uber and Lyft in ride-sharing — and the report argues that this leaves the other “loser” companies in those markets more likely to pay their workers less than they did before. Growing inequality between global and local industries. Local service industries face lower margins than globalized tech firms and can’t keep up with paying their employees as much. To improve workers’ wages across the board, the report calls for local and state government to support workers’ rights to organize, adopt better labor standards for subcontracted workers, increase taxes on corporate headquarters and provide affordable housing. With more political debate around how big tech companies pay employees and impact the communities they’re headquartered in — most recently seen through the political pressure placed on Amazon to raise its minimum wage — we might very well see more of a public debate over income inequality in years to come not just in Silicon Valley, but at tech companies across the nation.
