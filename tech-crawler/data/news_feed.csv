Review: Windows 10 October 2018 Update delivers modest but useful tweaks," The big twice-a-year Windows 10 update is here ... except this time, it’s not so big. The Windows 10 October 2018 Update, a.k.a. version 1809, is perhaps the least impressive of the major updates since Windows 10 was introduced. It sports no big, new capabilities like Timeline, the flagship feature of the Windows 10 April 2018 Update. Still, it’s got some good sleeper features, a hidden gem or two, a few bombs, and a host of useful if not groundbreaking features.The release will be rolled out to Windows 10 users in phases, so it might be some time before you see it arrive on your computer. In fact, the rollout was scheduled to begin on October 9, but after some users who upgraded to version 1809 reported problems including the loss of all files in their Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos folders, Microsoft paused the rollout. After more than a month's delay, the company finally resumed pushing out the release on November 13. If you want to delay the update even longer and then install it on your own schedule, here's how to block it temporarily.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3307851/microsoft-windows/review-windows-10-october-2018-update-delivers-modest-but-useful-tweaks.html#tk.rss_all,0,computerworld,,NULL,2018-11-13
Get Over 45 Hours Of Immersive Ethical Hacking Training For $25 (90% Off)," Your private data can reveal a lot about you, such as bank information, spending habits, and even the websites you frequent. This makes large companies like Facebook and Yahoo prime targets for data breaches because of their vast library of user data. Nowadays, it’s more important than ever for companies to remain vigilant against hackers, lest their customers’ privacy and trust be lost.To defend against such threats, companies hire security professionals who know how to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in security systems. These “ethical hackers” employ the same methods malicious hackers do, but they also patch and report these vulnerabilities to their employers to prevent future intrusions. With data breaches on the rise, the demand for ethical hackers has increased, making this career path both stable and profitable. If you’re interested in learning how to hack security systems (legally, of course) then this $39 Ethical Hacking A to Z Training Bundle is for you.To read this article in full, please click here",https://www.computerworld.com/article/3320620/security/get-over-45-hours-of-immersive-ethical-hacking-training-for-25-90-off.html#tk.rss_all,0,computerworld,"python,bootstrap,javascript,frontend,swift",NULL,2018-11-13

Pixel 3 vs. Pixel 2: Why smaller bezels aren't that big a deal," When you hear people talk about Google's Pixel 3 and whether it's worth the upgrade over the previous-gen Pixel 2, one consistent theme always comes up: If there's any reason to make the upgrade, it's for the smaller bezels and bigger screen.What folks are getting at, y'see, is the fact that the Pixel 3 packs more active display space into the same basic footprint as last year's model — which, on the surface, sure seems like a good thing. And it is a good thing!

The Linux desktop: With great success comes great failure," Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: &lt;yyyy&gt; will be the year of the Linux desktop. Even in Linux circles this is greeted with eye-rolling. Here’s the funny thing, though: Linux long ago won the hearts and minds of end users, even while the Linux desktop continues to spin its wheels.How can that be?The paradox is easily explained. But as for Linux’s failure to capture desktop hearts and minds, that’s a complicated story. I’ll lay it out for you.First, the paradox: According to the latest Annenberg Surveying the Digital Future report, the average American now spends 24 hours a week online.

IDG Contributor Network: HP design innovation on PCs and printers will spread to homes and offices," [Disclosure: HP is a client of the author.]My first portable PC (you’d never call it a laptop), was made by Panasonic. It cost something like $7K in today’s dollars (allowing for inflation), weighed 35 pounds and included a thermal printer. I also work from home so unlike my office-oriented peers, part of what I think about when I equip or update my home office is the printer — even though it’s no longer integrated with my laptop (thankfully). For much of my career, laptop design has largely been driven by one of two factors. Corporate buyers who had no taste (and resulted in a long period of time when hardware design could best be described as butt-ugly), or Apple, who tended to put form over function resulting in pretty but often unreliable or fragile products. (My first Apple laptop fell off a chair onto carpet and broke both hinges on its screen, something I’d never seen happen before or since.)

IDG Contributor Network: The lock-in problem hiding behind Apple’s unit sales declines," I hate lock-in. Lock-in is when you wrap a product up with so much proprietary stuff that the customer can’t move to a competing offering. The advantage to the company is that they dramatically reduce customer churn—thus reducing the need for marketing—and can focus sales efforts more on acquiring new customers, rather than keeping existing customers happy.That last part is also the problem, because once lock-in is achieved, companies tend to defund efforts to keep customers happy…and increasingly focus on raising prices as a way to raise revenues. Companies that embrace this strategy effectively morph from being customer-focused to being more like organized crime and a protection racket.

"Here’s what Amazon HQ2 employees will face in Long Island City when it comes to transportation, housing and ... sewage"," A lot of change is on the horizon for the Queens neighborhood. Amazon’s 14-month-long contest for a second headquarters is finally over. But for the two locations it ultimately chose — an area of Northern Virginia Amazon is calling “National Landing” and Long Island City, New York — the journey has just begun. The addition of Amazon’s HQ2 means that potentially 25,000 new employees will swarm each of those areas in the coming years. Long Island City, located in the biggest city in the U.S. — where overcrowding, aging infrastructure and a high cost of living present unique challenges — will surely be the trickier location of the two. Here’s a look at what Amazon and its employees will have to face in Long Island City. Transportation If you travel in NYC, you know that the subway delays have been awful. They’re somewhat less awful in Long Island City. Three of the major train lines in the area — the 7, G and E — were on time 85, 83 and 81 percent of the time, respectively, during weekdays in September, according to the MTA’s subway performance dashboard. That’s higher than the system-wide average of 80 percent on-time. The M train, however, was only punctual 76 percent of the time in September. The MTA is currently working on a new signal system for the 7 line that will allow at least two more trains per hour. It’s expected to be completed by the end of the year. New York City’s subway trouble, however, is not isolated to each subway line. “It’s a network that’s only as strong as its weakest link and it’s suffering right now tremendously,” according to Danny Pearlstein, policy and communications director for transit advocacy group Riders Alliance. “The question for the six million daily riders is, ‘Will the state come up with a plan to rescue the subway system?’” Performance of Long Island City’s major trains are highlighted in blue below: if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""]={},window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""].embedDeltas={""100"":793,""200"":692,""300"":650,""400"":650,""500"":633,""700"":633,""800"":633,""900"":633,""1000"":633},window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-r5CuK""),window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""r5CuK""==b)window.datawrapper[""r5CuK""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); Tax incentives Much of Long Island City is located within Opportunity Zones, economically distressed areas where new investments could be eligible for preferential tax treatment, according to Economic Innovation Group, a nonpartisan public policy organization. These investments are currently trendy among the tech industry’s wealthiest. Those areas are highlighted on the map below in orange. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering bypassing the normal process to rezone a 20-acre area along the Long Island City waterfront — which falls in Opportunity Zone territory — for Amazon use, according to Crain’s New York. Currently, the area is only zoned for low-rise manufacturing use. Housing Long Island City is the top New York City neighborhood for new residential development, so it has ample new housing for Amazon workers. About 3,000 units were completed in the first half of 2018, according to Localize.city, a New York City real estate platform that analyzed Department of Building data. Some 3,300 more are expected to be completed by 2020 — that represents about a fifth of all new units citywide. As a result of all this construction, rental prices have been in decline in the area. The addition of thousands more residents from Amazon, however, will likely stanch that fall. Below is a Localize map of all new LIC residential buildings from Jan. 1, 2008 to July 1, 2018. Lighter-colored buildings are still under construction. Commercial space Long Island City has a much higher office-vacancy rate — 24 percent — than even the U.S. at large (12 percent), according to real estate services company Cushman &amp; Wakefield. That means, should Amazon choose to lease existing office space, it would have a relatively easy time. That’s especially the case as several high-profile office tenants have left the area — including Citigroup. (Update: Citigroup now says Amazon plans to move into its tower at 1 Court Sq.) In general, LIC hasn’t historically been a major office market. High-end office space in LIC is also much cheaper than in Manhattan, at $48.20 a square foot compared with $84.17 in Midtown, according to Cushman. Infrastructure investment LIC’s infrastructure is already stretched thin — and that’s before adding an additional 25,000 Amazon employees. Luckily for — and perhaps because of — Amazon, the city recently committed to investing $180 million in the area. That includes $95 million earmarked for the area’s ailing sewer system and water mains. Here’s a map of Long Island City’s planned water and sewer improvements. The investments also include $60 million for a new school in the Court Square area, $15 million for parks and open-space improvements, and $10 million for street reconstruction to “provide safer connections for pedestrians and bicyclists.” That’s good, because Long Island City has more reports of blocked bike lanes than all of New York City, according to Localize. It also ranks first for the most parking complaints — more than 4,000 a year. The area also faces a shortage of essential amenities such as supermarkets and pharmacies, though perhaps a new Amazon Go store could fix that; Amazon’s first Amazon Go store sits on the ground floor of Amazon’s new Seattle headquarters. As far as other stores, 500,000 square feet of new retail space is expected by the early 2020s.

Jeff Bezos has confirmed the HQ2 decision and it’s the embodiment of Amazon’s emotionless practicality," Duh. It’s finally over. After more than a year of relentless media hype and desperate pleas from city officials, Amazon has finally announced the location(s) of its new HQ2 headquarters: Northern Virginia’s newly created National Landing neighborhood outside of Washington, D.C., and Long Island City in Queens, New York, situated across the East River from Manhattan. The Tuesday morning announcement — anticlimactic, for sure, after press reports over the last week detailed the company’s intentions — will let down those who were hoping Amazon might deviate from its DNA and take on a city that could use an economic boost and job growth — say, a Newark, N.J., or a Pittsburgh, Penn. The best Amazon offered was a 5,000-person “operations center of excellence” in Nashville. But a decision like putting a full headquarters in a place like Newark or Pittsburgh would have required a decision based, in part, on emotion. And for those who have followed Jeff Bezos’s company closely, that’s not the way Amazon has built an $800 billion business. Amazon makes decisions big and small based on data. From that point of view, the New York City and Washington, D.C., metro areas are logical choices. That’s because when the company first revealed its request for proposal in 2017, it listed this “requirement” near the top of its must-have list: “Locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent.” I should have listened when, over the last year, people with deep ties to Amazon advised me that a metro area’s talent pool would be the most important driver of a decision — yes, even more so than financial incentives. Amazon is getting $1.5 billion in incentives in Long Island City and $573 million in Northern Virginia, which is substantial. But the tech talent mattered more. And what do you see when you look at rankings of the top technology talent pools in the U.S.? Only two metro areas rank above the Washington, D.C., metro area: The San Francisco Bay Area, which Amazon never considered, and Seattle, the home of Amazon’s original headquarters. At No. 3, Washington, D.C., makes a lot of sense. Fourth is Toronto — but despite its booming tech scene, Amazon never gave any hints that it would seriously consider a big move across the border. Which brings us to No. 5 on the tech talent list: New York City. Ultimately, Amazon decided it needed two cities — whether it always knew this or not is up for debate — to meet its hiring demands and to reduce some of the potential downsides that Seattle has experienced as a result of Amazon’s 45,000-employee footprint there. All of this leads to uncomfortable questions for Amazon: If the company already knew that tech talent was the most critical factor in choosing new homes for 50,000 future employees, why didn’t it just handpick a few of the top cities with the requisite workforce and negotiate privately among them? If access to a large pool local tech talent was a “requirement,” did “finalists” like Nashville (No. 45 in tech talent nationwide) or Miami (No. 50) ever have a real shot? These are the queries that lend the most credence to the opinion of Amazon HQ2 critics — like professor and author Scott Galloway — who say the HQ2 “contest” was nothing more than a giant charade to wring as much financial benefit from Amazon’s preferred choices as possible. And that looks very, very bad. Using the HQ2 “search” as a brilliant — if out-of-touch — marketing campaign is one thing. But doing so while knowing the end result from the start would be something altogether worse. Either way, Amazon and Jeff Bezos have shown time and time again that they don’t care much about public perception — as long it’s not consumer perception. So the HQ2 — and HQ3 — decision was not an inspiring decision; it was a data-based decision. And that’s the most Amazon decision there is.

How Amazon’s HQ2 and HQ3 locations compare with Seattle and the U.S. overall," “National Landing” and Long Island City have high office vacancy rates and are both cheaper places to buy homes than Seattle. Update: This post was initially published on Nov. 6, before the Amazon HQ2 locations were confirmed. And then there were three. Amazon’s drawn-out public search for a second headquarters has officially concluded with two locations, National Landing, Va. (which appears to be a new, made-up neighborhood) and Long Island City, N.Y. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal first reported on the multiple headquarters last week. The decision essentially splits in half the 50,000 employees and $5 billion in capital expenditures Amazon had promised. Here’s a look at data for these new headquarters and how they compare to Seattle, the home of Amazon’s current headquarters, as well as to the U.S. at large. if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""]={},window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""].embedDeltas={""100"":756,""200"":575,""300"":497,""400"":458,""500"":433,""700"":433,""800"":419,""900"":394,""1000"":394},window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-8oOrB""),window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""8oOrB""==b)window.datawrapper[""8oOrB""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); The median home listing prices are highest in Seattle’s King County ($635K), compared with Queens ($598K) and Arlington ($592K), according to real estate site Trulia, though it’s likely that some of Amazon’s Long Island City workers would choose to live in the more expensive boroughs of Brooklyn ($775K) or Manhattan ($1.7M). Tech worker wages are also slightly higher in Amazon’s original metro area ($117K) than in New York City ($113K) and D.C. ($111K). Unsurprisingly, all three of Amazon’s headquarter cities are much more expensive than the U.S. average by most measures. It’s noteworthy that Long Island City hasn’t historically been a major office market. Some of the companies that called it home are leaving or have left. Longtime commercial tenant Citigroup is dramatically downsizing its footprint in its office tower. (Update: Citigroup now says Amazon plans to move into its tower at 1 Court Sq.) MetLife has continued to sublease its Long Island City office space following its move to Manhattan. What Long Island City does have is a lot of new apartment construction, contributing to an oversupply that’s leading to declining rental costs. Amazon’s move to have three instead of two headquarters reflects the difficulty in finding huge amounts of housing, office space and, most importantly, tech labor in any one locale, according to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times reports. New York City, D.C. and Seattle are some of the highest ranked on real estate research company CBRE’s annual list of tech talent, which factors in metrics including an area’s concentration of computer science degrees, the size of the existing tech industry and the cost of living.

Airbnb is donating $5 million toward helping the homeless in San Francisco," It’s the biggest donation the company has made in its hometown to date. Airbnb is making its biggest donation yet in its hometown — $5 million — toward helping address the homelessness crisis in San Francisco. The announcement comes at a time when politicians and social justice organizations are increasingly calling upon tech companies to give more to the city where they created their wealth. Last week, San Franciscans voted to pass a “homelessness tax” — Prop C — on large corporations in the city. The issue has divided the tech community. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff helped bring national attention to Prop C by sparring on Twitter with tech CEOs such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in defense of the measure, and accusing some San Francisco billionaires of hoarding their wealth instead of opening their pocketbooks to help the city’s most needy. While Airbnb has taken no official stance on Prop C, the donation is a sign that the company is willing to publicly commit to a bigger role in helping out on the issue. “We are proud to call this city our home, and we know we have a deep responsibility to step up and help find solutions to some of our hometown’s most pressing issues, including homelessness,” the company wrote in a blog post this morning. It’s a far cry from what some called a tone-deaf attitude a few years back, when the company ran a “Dear San Francisco” ad campaign telling the city how to spend the taxes it collects from the company. Airbnb has yet to announce the specifics about how it will distribute the funds, but the company has talked with organizations and leaders such as Benioff and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, and nonprofits The Tipping Point Foundation and Hamilton House, according to a spokesperson for Airbnb.

Is the Daily Beast the new Gawker?," The site’s new Editor in Chief Noah Shachtman wants to take “full, big, considered swings” at the targets who deserve it. Noah Shachtman, the editor in chief of the Daily Beast, has three rules about covering the Trump administration. “Fuck access journalism, number one,” Shachtman said on the latest episode of Recode Media. “Number two, you better have some sources, right? And luckily number three is, in this administration ... Like, more than advancing any policy, and more than anything, is these guys want to stab each other in the back, these guys in the Trump administration.” Plus, he told guest host Steven Perlberg, he doesn’t expect political sources to trade intel to the Daily Beast anyway. The 10-year-old site has long prided itself on its scrappy, skeptical attitude. “They all know we’re a bunch of velociraptors around here,” Shachtman said. “We’re just gonna bite the hand off if you spoon-feed us. So we’re a dumb outlet to spoon-feed to. However, we’re an awesome outlet to leak to.” Calling the site a “high-end tabloid,” he said he admired the IAC-owned site’s ability to “take a side and throw a punch and call bullshit on the things that need to be called bullshit on.” But he’s also glad to be “owned by one of these giant globo-corps” for the inevitable legal threats that are thrown at the Daily Beast, like the Peter Thiel-engineered lawsuit that took down Gawker. “I think that we like to embrace the gonzo and that Gawker was an inheritor of that gonzo spirit that didn’t originate with Gawker, but that they carried that mantle for a little while,” Shachtman said. “We really like the gonzo. We really like the weird. We really like the fun and we don’t give that many fucks. We don’t give zero fucks, but we don’t give that many fucks.” You can listen to Recode Media wherever you get your podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a full transcript of Steven’s conversation with Noah. Steven Perlberg: This is Recode Media, from the Vox Media Podcast Network. I’m Steven Perlberg, in for Peter Kafka. I’m a media and politics reporter at BuzzFeed News, but I’m here at Vox Media Studios today in New York City. Today I’m really excited to be back in the studio. You might have heard my interview with Matt Taibbi a couple weeks back. This week, I’m here with Noah Shachtman, the editor in chief of the Daily Beast. Noah, welcome to Recode Media. Noah Shachtman: Hey. So, the Daily Beast just celebrated its 10-year anniversary. Mazel tov. Thank you. Our listeners probably know the Beast from its mix of reporting on everything from politics to national security, White House, pop culture. I wanted to start with ... You know my boss over at BuzzFeed News, Ben Smith, and I was telling him that I was coming to interview you. He brought up a point, that he feels like you guys are kind of like BuzzFeed News maybe circa 2012, where you’re scrappy, you take these big swings. You sort of have fewer resources than the competition. You know, you prize scoops big and small. You’re sort of hyper-aggressive. You’re fast. But with that kind of comes the risk of all that comes with being a smaller, scrappier outlet. So I’m curious, is that a fair way to talk about the Beast now? Like, how do you think of yourselves? In the media ecosystem, where do you fit in among the competitors? Yeah. I mean, I would agree with the “scrappy” part, and I would agree that we are like crackheads for scoops. I don’t know, necessarily, that I’d compare it exactly to BuzzFeed 2012. To me, we’re more of a mix of like the old-school New York tabloids ... I grew up in New York, and so I grew up reading the Daily News and the New York Post when they were at their height ... And mixing that with, in some ways, my experience working for Condé Nast magazines. It was kind of like the slick, glossy, global, smart outlook of those. You put those two together and give them a bizarre Frankenstein love child and you have the Daily Beast. Do you think of yourself as a tabloid? Is that something that you communicate to your reporters? Does that bring a different kind of sensibility to your reporting? Does it give you more leeway? Yeah. I think we consider ourselves a high-end tabloid, a global tabloid, for sure. And yeah, that means no boring headlines, right? That means the ability to take a side and throw a punch and call bullshit on the things that need to be called bullshit on. Which I think for the “broadsheets” of the world, can be more difficult. We’re now two years into the Trump administration. There’s a ton of hand-wringing over how to cover this story. You guys, I think, have made a name for yourself with some of the White House scoops you’ve had, national security scoops. What have you, as an editor in chief in this Trump era, what have you learned about journalism, about media, about covering Trump in this age? Has your worldview changed about journalism and how to cover the story, or not really? No, I think ... Well, I mean first of all, the basic journalistic principles apply for all time, no matter who’s in the White House, and no matter what the media environment is. I think with this president, it’s interesting. Just to take a step back, Bob Woodward used to say that the business of D.C. journalism was to uncover the secret state. Right? And that still applies. But in the Trump administration, you have something weird, which is that oftentimes the deepest secrets are mirrored on the president’s Twitter feed. So, it’s like what’s visible and what’s invisible are often kind of twinned, in a very interesting way that you wouldn’t see in the Obama administration, which was generally more secretive and buttoned-up. So, that’s one thing. Then the other thing is like ... Look, the minor details in this administration are so telling. You know, we did a story a while back about how Rex Tillerson found out that he was fired when he was on the toilet. And everyone remembers that detail. Yeah. But it’s also telling about the way that the Trump administration treats its own most senior members, right? Like it’s not just a tee-hee funny story ... Although it’s totally fucking funny. Right. It’s also a story about the power dynamics between Tillerson and the White House. It’s a story about how Trump treats these guys, who, months earlier, he was lauding as total geniuses. Not to make you sort of criticize the competition, but do you think that traditional media has been ill-equipped to handle the Trump moment? Because you see sort of this insurgency of ... Well, you see the traditional media outlets having this sort of renaissance. The Post and the Times are doing really well. But at the same time, it feels like sometimes there’s ... Like I was saying, there’s a ton of hand-wringing about what this moment means and how to cover it. And I’m curious, what is your diagnosis of how traditional media has handled the Trump moment? Yeah. I mean, I think you’re hinting at it. Look, the Post and the Times have been totally lights out. They’ve been incredible, no doubt about it. They are the heavyweight champs of the world, and they’ve really proven it in this cycle. I think some of the other legacy outlets have really stumbled on the job. Really, really stumbled on the job. Repeating uncritically the president’s lies — I just don’t think that that’s the job of journalism, is to serve as a mouthpiece for power. I think getting gamed and distracted a lot by the president’s nonsense … I think there’s been a lot of allowing the president of the United States to be the assignment editor, and that’s a giant mistake. Right. I mean, something like ... We’re recording this November 2nd, but something happened yesterday. Trump had this press conference, and CNN and Fox News go to it. I think CNN went to it for 15 minutes or so before they realized, like, “There’s no news here.” But that sort of thing. Right? Where all these news outlets just sort of, I don’t know, by habit, go live to Trump, and it’s like he’s there to talk about the caravan and distract, or things like that. You guys don’t really have to be in that camp. Yeah. Look. Luckily, we’re not anybody’s paper of record. Right? And so, we don’t feel obligated to cover those things. Or if we do, it’s to cover them critically. Here’s another example. The day before that, there was this break, in which the president floated this idea that he was gonna somehow single-handedly, with a wave of a hand, undo the 14th Amendment. Which is A) nuts, B) likely unconstitutional and C) nobody else in the White House was talking about this. There had been basically no prep work, or the prep work had been like, “Hey, Mr. President. I know you want to do this, but, uh, no.” Right, and then it comes out in this Axios clip, and then it’s sort of repeated uncritically by the rest of the pack. Yeah. And then it becomes, “Can he do this?” And then of course, then there’s the fact-checking. Right. Where people are like, “Actually, no!” And I understand how these editors in other places feel. I saw that clip and I was like, “Oh my God.” “What a scoop.” ”We gotta get an opinion piece. We gotta get this, we gotta get that.” And then we all took a deep breath ... My wife’s a meditation teacher, so ... That’s helpful in the Trump era. Yeah. And then we said, “Wait a minute. This is like total nonsense, and this is like him saying, ‘Yeah, sure,’ to a ridiculous idea that was floated.” And so we said, “You know what? The bigger story is not whatever the president’s bullshit proposal is. It’s the fact that a madman, a Nazi, murdered 11 people in a synagogue the weekend before. It’s the fact that a pro-Trump superfan had been mailing bombs around the country. That’s the story. The story is the upswing in domestic terrorism here, not whatever ridiculousness the president happens to pick out of his nose that moment.” I’m glad you brought up the Axios thing, because I wanted to talk about that. This is a term that gets thrown around a lot, sort of access journalism, right? Mm-hmm. Jonathan Swan, the reporter who broke that story, he was really ... I don’t know. He got ratio’d very hard on Twitter for sort of giddily responding to Trump. Yeah. You know what? Hold up. Can I step in there? Yeah, yeah. I think that’s actually wrong and dumb. Why? Jonathan Swan is a motherfucking monster of a reporter and any newsroom would be happy to have him. Totally. He is sourced, he is smart and he writes great. I think they captured a moment in which he was like, “Oh my God. I can’t believe this is happening.” Right. Right? This is like the print reporter who goes on television and he’s happy he got the scoop. And I don’t know, it comes out weird. Is that sort of …? Yeah. I mean, Jonathan is a little bit more media-friendly than that. But I think he was just like, “Oh my God. I can’t believe ...” ”Trump just confirmed this thing that I heard.” Yeah, exactly. And so, I thought that was really unfair to Jonathan. What do you think, though, of the sort of broader critique of that style of access journalism made popular by Mike Allen, maybe, at Politico? That it’s sort of wrong for the Trump moment, that it doesn’t make sense based on who you’re covering, and that that model just doesn’t really work anymore, and shouldn’t be a thing. You guys kind of have that outsider approach. Like, you don’t really have that same sort of model, but at the same time, you have sources in the White House and that’s how you break stories. Yeah. So how do you think about it as an editor? Yeah. So, look. Fuck access journalism, number one. Number two, you better have some sources, right? And luckily number three is, in this administration ... Like, more than advancing any policy, and more than anything, is these guys want to stab each other in the back, these guys in the Trump administration. And so basically you want to get them talking about, you know ... So, you don’t have to be spoon-fed anything to get stories. In fact, probably worse off. Yeah. And the other thing is, frankly, who’s gonna spoon-feed to the Daily Beast? Like, they all know we’re a bunch of velociraptors around here. We’re just gonna bite the hand off if you spoon-feed us. Right. So we’re a dumb outlet to spoon-feed to. However, we’re an awesome outlet to leak to. We’re an awesome outlet to dish to. And so, I think that’s just been our approach. You are opinionated on Twitter about Trump. You got yourself into a mini media controversy a few years ago. Mm-hmm. I think your tweet was written up in conservative media. I was just looking. Howard Kurtz of Fox News wrote a story about it. Yeah, which is hilarious. I want to read your tweet. You said, “Let’s get real. If you’re renting in a Trump building or playing a round of golf at a Trump resort, you are supporting racism and neo-fascism.” That was in 2015. That was a different moment. Trump was a different kind of phenomenon. Now he’s president. Mm-hmm. Do you either regret tweeting that, or if not, has that made it harder for your reporters? Does that make it harder to cover this administration, because they ... Or, not at all? Like, do sources give your reporters a hard time because they know, “Hey, your boss just called him a fascist on Twitter in 2015”? Yeah. I think there was a brief moment when the Trump campaign was not pleased about that. I’ll leave it to your listeners to decide whether that tweet was prescient or not. You know? And I don’t regret doing the tweet. Just to give you the backstory. It’s kind of fun. I was ... No, no. I want to take it out of context. I want to take one tweet completely out of context. Good. Good, I appreciate that. It’s very 2018. Yeah, yeah. So, look. I was in Miami on vacation, on Thanksgiving vacation, and I was sitting there holding my, uh ... Margarita. No, my son. Oh, okay. Different. Yeah. Yeah, this story took a very different turn. And I was just thinking about some of the divisive things that had been going on in the campaign, and it really ... You know, holding my little Jewish boy in my arms, rocking him to sleep, I just couldn’t believe that our country was taking this kind of turn. And so I fired that tweet off as I was rocking him to sleep. Because, you know, I’m an editor at a New York publication and that’s what we do. I don’t regret the tweet. What I do think is that if you’re gonna take swings, you might as well take, like, full ... Big swings. Full, big, considered swings. And also, the idea that Howard Kurtz, who got fired from the Daily Beast for any number of war crimes against journalism, is like, you critiquing me is a fucking joke. Right. I’m curious, though. I don’t know if this is something that you’re seeing at other outlets, where someone on the right, maybe some conservative media troll, digs up a tweet from 2013, in context or out of context, and then comes after a reporter. This happened to Kaitlan Collins... Look. All publishers and all editors, if you fall for this trick, it’s on you. So, yeah. I wanted to ask you about it, because it’s obviously ... She tweeted homophobic things in college. But at the same time, let’s say someone comes after your reporter who tweeted something slightly racist in 2011. It’s maybe out of context, maybe not, but it’s a bad tweet. What do you do? Do you respond? And do you punish that reporter? I mean, of course this is hypothetical, but this is something that all editors are now dealing with. No. Let’s take it out of the realm of hypothetical. Okay. Let’s put it in the realm of the real. Okay, so let’s say Kaitlan Collins works for you. Well, here. I’ll keep it ... You’re Jeff Zucker. I’ll make it totally concrete. Okay. So the Daily Beast had, for a long time, a columnist named Joy Reid, who also has a show on MSNBC. Joy Reid, you know, there was a bunch of blog posts that were dug up about her that were bad. They were definitely bad. Right, right. And she apologized for the first tranche of those, and we said, “Okay. These are from 10 years ago or whatever, 10-plus years ago. Judging someone on their bad blog posts when they were a talk radio host? No. We’re not gonna do that. We’re not gonna be fooled by the trick. No problem.” Okay. Then fast-forward, I don’t know, six months or something like that, and a second tranche came up. Right, and now she says she got hacked. Right. And now she says it wasn’t her. It’s the Shaggy defense. “It wasn’t me.” Sure. And so we interrogated that response, that claim that she was hacked. We put our best cybersecurity reporter on it, Kevin Poulsen, who himself is a former hacker. And within 24 hours, he was able to prove that that claim was nonsense. So then we cut ties with Joy Reid, not because of the bad blog posts but because she hadn’t owned up to it and apologized. Right. But the Joy Reid case, that was sort of its own thing, because it was obviously the cover-up. It was a ridiculous claim, that she had been hacked, and even though she sort of apologized for it, to this day still sort of ... MSNBC, I don’t think has been fully forced to reckon with the fact that she’s never exactly admitted that she wasn’t hacked. But let’s say you’re the president of CNN and it’s a reporter’s tweet. Do you respond ... When someone’s not saying they were hacked. I mean, they did it, right? But it’s a completely bad-faith attack. How do you deal with that? It’s something that I think a lot of editors think about these days. Yeah. They really shouldn’t be. I mean ... Yeah. Just don’t respond, don’t engage? Yeah, just don’t respond. Or just tell them, “Hey, look, we’re gonna stand by our reporter.” Without getting into the details ... As you can imagine, the ultra-right trolls try to pull this trick on our reporters all the time, and we just kind of laugh at them. Yeah. What is your stance about ... I mean, the Times, BuzzFeed, has a social media policy. Mm-hmm. You know, feels strongly about what its reporters can and can’t say on Twitter. Really? Oh, yeah. Like what? We have a social media policy. We can’t be like ... And this has burned people at BuzzFeed in the past. You know, it’s like if you tweet something super ... People have tweeted something partisan or ... Oh. Okay, here’s our general rule. Yeah, yeah. Our general rule is: A, you’re reporters, not cheerleaders. So don’t be an open partisan; B, don’t do something that ... I mean, obviously, don’t do anything that’s like hate speech or in any way is gonna offend a group. Because if it’s ethnicity or gender, or what have you ... Then C is don’t get your fellow reporters in trouble. Right. Don’t tweet something dumb that’s gonna jam up ... The beat reporter on whatever. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like, just don’t be an asshole. Right. Be a good colleague. Yeah, exactly. I think that leaves a lot of room for having fun and for voicing one’s personal opinions and for also being a good reporter. I just don’t see a lot of tension there. In fact, I can’t believe we’re talking about it this much. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think it’s like the Times released their new social media policy. It was like, I can’t believe we’re doing this again, what reporters can and can’t say on Twitter. It’s like, we’re having this debate in 2018? I know. And it’s just like, look. The best example is like, who’s the best White House reporter at the Times right now? Maggie Haberman. Who’s got the most lit Twitter feed of anybody at the Times? Maggie Haberman. Right. So, obviously those two things are not in tension. In fact, I would argue that in the Trump era, they sometimes go hand in hand. I wanted to ask, since I’ve covered the media business at BuzzFeed and before, at the Wall Street Journal, one of the things that I always remember about the Beast is that it’s always emphasized to media reporters on the business side, is a lack of reliance on Facebook. That’s always been sort of a big thing. I’m curious now: A lot of publishers in the last few months have been struggling with Facebook changing its algorithm. Yup. And so it made me think, this is something that you guys have harped on for years, and maybe you were slightly ahead of the competitors. But I’m curious, have you seen like a big traffic dip, like some of your competitors, because of the Facebook algorithm tweak, or do you feel like you were, I don’t know, immune to some of the bad changes in the digital media business over the past few months? So, look. Overall, our traffic is way up over last year. So, while Facebook has gone down as a percentage of traffic ... What percentage of traffic does it make up for you guys now? Minimal. I mean, it’s pretty small. I actually don’t have the figure off the top of my head. Yeah, yeah. Because that’s how important it is. Yeah, look, we always viewed with skepticism the idea that you should surrender your content for free to any third party, but especially one run by an android wearing human skin, like Facebook. And so, you know, we just never played that game. Similarly, your friend Ben Smith and I have long had a difference of opinion about whether homepages are important. Right? And we’ve always felt like homepages were important. They’re a statement of values. They’re a statement of editorial priorities. And when done right, they can be fun. So we’ve always put a premium on our homepage, too. So it’s made us a little bit retro, but we think it’s served us well. Where do you — now that we’re taping this right before the midterms, but we’re about to gear up again — where are you devoting resources in the next, I don’t know, 18 months? I mean, do you guys feel like you’re ... We’re gonna pivot to video. Pivot to video? Great. Yeah. All video, all the time. All podcasts? Yup. I guess, yeah. Where do you see the business outlook going forward? What are your priorities, where to devote resources? Yeah. Look, we’re pretty happy with where we are. We think we’re headed in the right direction. How big is the newsroom now? How big is the newsroom? It’s like 40-ish is the newsroom, and an equivalent number on the business side, pretty much. I think I’m not supposed to talk a bunch about internals, because the Daily Beast is owned by IAC, which is a public company. Oh, I’m getting to that. Don’t worry. Yeah, okay. Cool. But what I’d note is that, I think the statistic I’m allowed to talk about is that revenue in the second quarter — because that’s the last one in which the earnings report mentioned the Daily Beast — was up like 66 percent. So I think we’re doing good journalistically, and we’re making moves on revenue, and so we’re pretty happy with where we are. I think what we’re not gonna do is, we’re not gonna try to — if this is your question, it may not be — but we’re not gonna try to radically expand and grow super big. Right. Or turn ourselves around and become something that we aren’t. I think we’re going to keep doing what we do. And what we find is that over time we just try to get people more into being like reading the Daily Beast every day. The more that happens, the better it is for us, and we think that we deliver a great daily experience, and so we’re trying to get more folks to do that. Right. So you’ve been at the Daily Beast since 2014, right? Correct. So you were sort of the No. 2 guy behind John Avlon, and he left, and so how long have you been running the show now? Since May. Since May. In my mind, it’s only been a decade of Daily Beast, but I kind of feel like you do have these three eras, like Tina Brown started it, so that era, John’s era, and now you’re in charge. What do you see as your sort of view and outlook and what kind of Daily Beast do you want to have, versus sort of prior eras? Is it a continuation, or is it something that, you have sort of a new target in mind? Yeah. Look, John and I were partners for sure from 2014 on, and so I think this thing we kind of helped work on together. I think that identity isn’t going to change a lot more. I do think you’ll see us branching out into different media formats. The Daily Beast has been definitely behind a little bit in terms of like stuff that’s not text-based, and so we’re experimenting with a bunch of ... So you are pivoting to video. Look, after all this. I know. That’s gonna be the headline. Yeah, exactly. That’s gonna be awesome, dude. Yeah, so we’re dipping our toe into a bunch of different areas. We’re having some real success in Hollywood too. We’ve sort of unexpectedly become like a little bit of a hit factory for Hollywood, and so we’ve got ... Yeah, so the McDonald’s [story] ... Yeah, but that’s not the only one. I’m not sure how ... You want to break news? I’m not sure how many of these I can talk about, but we’ve had like a bunch of stories in the last six months that have turned from articles and been optioned by Hollywood, pretty much overnight. Right, and this is something that a lot of newsrooms — Buzzfeed included — are thinking of, what are the new revenue streams that we can get? Can we sell a story to a Netflix? BuzzFeed has done this. Can we sell an idea to some sort of TV player? And so yeah, that’s an interesting revenue stream for publishers. Yeah, I don’t think it’s going to be humongous, but I think that’s interesting. Then look, we’re really big believers in this membership program of ours. We’re offering members of Beast Inside really exclusive, really top-end material. So like today, for example, we commissioned a poll with Ipsos right in advance of the midterms and members are the only ones that are going to get it. How do your reporters feel about, speaking as a reporter, about going behind the paywall versus not? Is that something that ... I know, I used to work at the Wall Street Journal, so I wanted as many people to read my things as possible, so but I get why the publisher wants people to pay for it. Yeah, so far there hasn’t been huge tension around it. So far it’s so clear that if you can get somebody to sign up because of a scoop it’s so valuable to the company that so far the reporters have been cool with it. I’m not sure if you can say, but how meaningful a part of your business is that now? Is that ... I mean, it’s just getting started, but we’ve got thousands and thousands of subscribers already. I wanted to ask also, so you mentioned IAC, it’s chaired by the well-known media mogul Barry Diller, how active is Barry in the business? How often do you talk to him and what is that like? Yeah, so we’ve got monthly meetings with him. We talk about a mix of business and editorial. Pivoting to video. Yeah, exactly. Pivoting to Myspace. And then [we] email back and forth, but it’s been pretty cool. There’s literally nobody smarter in the media business and nobody smarter about media, and I feel like I’m a corporate shill saying that, but it just in this case, happens to be true. I’ve gotten to see over the years that he really calls in no favors and pulls no punches and ... He’s not calling you up asking you to delete stories about his powerful friends? No. Dude, no. He’s giving you tips about his powerful friends? No, it’s not like that, but look, as you can imagine, Barry Diller has a lot of powerful friends and they voice their opinions about the Daily Beast, but it really hasn’t trickled down to us at all. It’s actually been a pleasure. One of the things, and correct me if I’m wrong here, but I think that you guys view covering campaigns a little differently. I’m not sure that ... do you put reporters on the trail and now that we’re day after the midterms gearing up for 2020 ... Shoot me. ... how are you thinking about your plan for 2020? We’re thinking about ... all newsrooms are staffing up or allocating resources towards 2020 and as an editor, it’s just going to be the big story of the next two years. What’s your outlook on that? Yeah, we have traditionally shied away from the traditional campaign coverage of, “Candidate says X at rally Y.” I don’t know how much value that really brings to a reader. I think we’ll be really honestly doing more investigative work on these candidates. There’s so many candidates. There’s going to be so much dirt to dig on all these guys. There’s going to be a lot of great behind-the-scenes power struggles that are going to be really fun to report on, so my instinct is to go that way. Do you think, now that the attention is kind of swinging back to the Democratic Party, I don’t know, do you feel like as an editor you’re trying to ... I mean, do you think next year is going to be like the past two years where it’s all Trump all the time or do you think it’s going to be going back to some sort of ... I don’t know. I’m just curious how the media landscape changes when Trump might not be the story of the day, that it’s going to be some primary battle or something. Yeah. Or is he going to be narrating that in real time and he’s still going to be the story. Please predict what’s going to happen. Yeah, okay. Well, so I’ll predict this: I think next year may be the craziest year yet. Oh God. Yeah, I know. Don’t say that. I’m sorry. I’m really sorry but I think it’s true. I think that if the Democrats take control of either House, which we’ll see what happens. Yeah, when this airs I think it will probably ... I think there’s going to be a lot of pressure to really open up the investigations against the president and there’s so many avenues, so I think that’s going to be crazy. I think you’re going to have, there’s still a lot of road left on the federal law enforcement investigations into the Trump circle. That’s going to be crazy. Then you’re going to have approximately 942 candidates for president, and that’s going to be crazy, Like Michael Avenatti. Yeah, yeah. I think we might have drained that well. I’m curious, talking to folks beforehand about what I should ask you and somebody suggested that they feel like you guys have taken up the mantle of Gawker a little bit. Like now that there isn’t that player in the media ecosystem, there have been so many times where people are like, like, “Oh you know, what if Gawker were around to cover this story?” Do you feel like you try to fill some of that void of that sort of style? Because you guys, you’re willing to cover things that other outlets might find too insidery, but it’s like if you can get a scoop on it or if it’s an interesting story ... Look, I think that we like to embrace the gonzo and that Gawker was an inheritor of that gonzo spirit that didn’t originate with Gawker, but that they carried that mantle for a little while. We really like the gonzo. We really like the weird. We really like the fun and we don’t give that many fucks. We don’t give zero fucks, but we don’t give that many fucks. How do you feel about the ever-present legal threats that are hanging over ...? Yeah, they’re for real, man. They’re for real. You guys take big swings. You’ve made some mistakes. You correct them but you’ve made some big mistakes and a lot of newsrooms have, but how do you think about that? How do you view that? Yeah, look, the legal threats are definitely out there. Luckily we’re owned by one of these giant globo-corps and they have a really crack team of lawyers, and so we’ve really ... there’s been very little successful litigation against us. Yeah. All right, well that was pretty painless. We established that the Daily Beast is pivoting to video and diverting all of its 2020 resources towards covering Michael Avenatti’s campaign. Yes. Yeah, that is true. That about does it, so Noah, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Are you fucking kidding me? Oh my God. Okay, great, amazing. How about I interview you for a little while? Go for it. You have any questions? Yeah, what the hell, Perlberg? You know? I’m all for it. Hit me with it. What have you got? You know, here’s my first question. What the fuck? Was that good? Was that a bad interview? No, no, it was great. Awesome. All right, well thank you, Noah, so much for coming on the podcast.

How a Democratic fundraiser taught everyone his Silicon Valley tricks," RevUp CEO Steve Spinner cracked the code on raising money for politicians online. And he says it’s not so different from raising money for a startup. On a recent episode of Recode Decode, RevUp Software CEO Steve Spinner talked with Recode’s Teddy Schleifer about how political fundraising has changed in the past 10 years and how it’s going to keep changing in the future. Speaking before the midterms, Spinner — formerly a big-money fundraiser for Democrats like Barack Obama and now distancing himself from partisanship — reflected on how he used data to “put the right ask in front of the right person at the right time” in 2008 and 2012. RevUp, he explained, lets users tap their own Rolodexes to figure out who to focus on rather than mass-emailing all your contacts and hoping for the best, a common tactic. “No one in business would conduct their work that way, just winging it, sending out one email to every vendor out there and hoping that someone replies or just, without any research, reaching out to people indiscriminately,” Spinner said. “We would do research. We would try to handle it in a professional, efficient manner. We don’t do that in fundraising.” You can listen to Recode Decode wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Pocket Casts and Overcast. Below, we’ve shared a lightly edited full transcript of Teddy’s full conversation with Steve. Teddy Schleifer: I’m here with Steve Spinner, the founder and CEO of RevUp Software. He’s the campaign chair for Congressman Ro Khanna and he previously worked as the California finance chair for the Obama-Biden 2012 campaign. Steve, welcome to Recode Decode. Steve Spinner: Nice to see you, Teddy. So we’re here to talk about Steve’s background in political fundraising. Obviously, a lot of listeners here might be more familiar with startup fundraising. I used to cover, in my old life, campaign finance and donors and know Steve. But for folks who don’t know who you are, I want to start with how’d you get to Silicon Valley? You’re not from here originally. Like so many people from California, they come from elsewhere, originally. I am definitely like that. I was born and bred on Long Island, New York, to a doctor’s family. Where in New York? Long Island, or if I’m supposed to correctly pronounce it, Long Giland, but it’s a while since I’ve had that accent. And, I broke my dad’s heart at college when I took economics and fell in love with that and told him I wasn’t premed, and ever since then, I worked on the east coast and I worked a lot internationally in my 20s. I worked in Europe and in Asia and then I worked in Atlanta for the Olympics and then went to business school up in Boston and then worked at NBC in New York, at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Did that in the late ’90s, when it was owned by General Electric for a number of years. What were you doing at NBC? Business development, corporate development? So I was there when MSNBC was formed and I was involved in all the internet activities that they did and had a fantastic time there. And did that for a couple of years in New York City. And then an opportunity came up that if the deal happened, I knew it was, they were going to ask me to leave the bosom of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. A wonderful, wonderful building to work in, overlooking the Christmas tree. Even though I’m a proud Jew and I love ... You can still go ice skating, so there’s some solace there. Yeah, I’m not, I’m not very good on skates. But I loved the office and then the opportunity came up and they had me come out to California and I’ve never looked back. So I came over here in ’98. Still with NBC, then. Yeah. NBC initially, I was there for another couple years. Had a wonderful ride there. And you know, had been doing business development, turned me into a general manager, turned me into an executive. Really formative years professionally for me in my late 20s, early 30s. And I’ve been here ever since. So, I’ve been here for 20 years. And I’ve done a number of startups out here, have done things on the investment side. But yes, I did definitely get involved in politics for the first time in 2005 right after the Kerry loss, where I first started getting involved in fundraising. Were you a political junkie growing up or is it something you were just not really ...? No, the exact opposite. I am the problem with the 20-somethings, so I am the epitome of that. I was very, very focused on my career, learning skills that I thought I would need for the rest of my life professionally. And I was not at all, at all engaged, even though I went to Wesleyan University for undergrad and I’m a proud Wesleyan graduate. I was not politically engaged in my 20s and into my early 30s. And I’ve regretted it ever since, having not been involved earlier in my life. But I made up for it ... You have. More than made up for it in the years since. There you go. Let’s talk about ... So, in 2004 John Kerry loses, you said after that, that was the moment where you started getting involved. What was the first time you got involved in campaign finance? Yeah, so the first moment was a perfect example of Silicon Valley leadership slash potential naivete. And I was the poster child for that where little old me, after the loss said, “You know what? Maybe if I had been involved, maybe I could have had a small difference in the outcome.” And many of us felt the same way. And so, very simple, I just called up a couple of friends of mine who had been very engaged in politics and had done it at a senior level, were at the time known as very, very strong fundraisers. And I just said, “Hey, look, I can’t work in politics. I don’t want to work, I like being a tech person, but I want to get involved. I want to help try to see if I can make a difference, albeit a small one.” In the aggregate, it adds up to a lot, if a lot of people do. And so they said, “That’s great. Come to an event, come contribute, that’s great.” I went to it in February of 2005. Who was the guy who invited you? Well, the first one was a guy named Donnie Fowler who was running for DNC chair. And the second one, a few weeks later, was for Senator Ted Kennedy. And after those two checks, the third one that I could ask for, and I’m like, “Whoa, you haven’t met my wife.” These checks are coming too fast and they’re too big. I can’t afford to do all this writing. So if you can’t write all these things, what else can you do? And that’s when they introduced me to raising. The art of fundraising. Which is different, because, I mean, you’re not a billionaire, you’re a regular guy. Exactly. But the art of fundraising is there’s givers and there’s fundraisers and some people straddle it. So it’s 2005 and you’re sort of introduced to this by a couple people in Silicon Valley. And that’s it. I tried to treat it like business and say, okay, if I’m going to do this, what are the right ways to do it? What are the best practices that you can share? And I was very quickly disappointed when they said there are no best practices. It’s fundraising, you know, you get an invitation, you get an email, you get a link and you send it out, or you talk to people. And after many times, many failed attempts to try to get the best practices of what are the dos, the don’ts, I just, everyone threw up their arms and I just started doing it myself. And I’m sure for the first six, nine months I made every possible mistake you can, every amateur thing you could do. This is for the 2006 midterm cycle? In 2006. Just trying to help. I was helping Mark Gorenberg with win back the House. Another venture capitalist in town. But he was major political fundraiser. He’s kind of slowed down. He’s not as ... In the last decade, he has. Ever since Obama won. Yeah. But at the time, he had been Kerry’s California chair. What I did for Obama in 2012, he did for Kerry in 2004. And so I just started helping him and I just started realizing that there’s a very high correlation to raising money for a candidate as there is raising money for a company. You have to be really passionate about what it is that you’re trying to get people excited about and inspired so much that they’re interested in giving, in whatever appropriate amount it is for them. And if you could just use certain skills that you would do in a business world, which is try to put the right ask in front of the right person at the right time and be respectful — and the keyword there is be respectful — then people are more likely to be interested in participating. It’s the opposite of this spray-and-pray of sending out an email to 5,000 people or 500,000 people and getting 0.0001 percent to click on it and then give low, medium, high dollars. Mine was the opposite. Mine was a curative manner of just trying to be, you know, if I knew someone liked climate change, to be able to put a climate change event in front of them. If I knew someone liked to go to a small intimate event of six, 12 people, to put that in front of them. If I knew that someone liked to go to big events of 1,000 people, to do that. If people were willing to travel, to be able to do that as well. The big thing was, I’m preempting this here, talking about Obama, but the big event was the Obama-Oprah event in Montecito and Santa Barbara in 2007. That was one where we were involved in the Obama campaign and that’s one that had just such interest nationally, at the time. But you know, I was able to be, after Oprah herself, the largest fundraiser for it, just because there were so many people that would ... Oprah and Steve Spinner. Yeah, no. There is a cool picture about that, but that’s about the extent of that. But let’s just drill down a little more on how fundraising is done and what made what you were doing different. I mean, fundraising is not that different from basic human relationships where you’re thinking about people you know, and you try and bond with people that ... You’re not just going around and saying, “Hello, these are the Forbes 400, let’s ask each of them for $2,700.” Basically you’re using, I’m assuming, I’m sure at first, Silicon Valley, the people you know in town. Describe the art of the ask. How’s it done? Pre-RevUp. Before RevUp and even before me, historically, for fundraising at very high levels, let’s just talk about the presidential level. Let’s talk about Obama in 2007, since I just preempted it with my last comment about Oprah. Before 2007, what had happened in 2004, what happened in 2000 and even in the ’90s, a lot times the best “fundraisers” at the time were uber-wealthy individuals who had for many, many years been extremely, exceedingly generous with their own funds, giving to their causes, more importantly giving to others’ causes as well, so that when they got passionate about a candidate that they wanted to see be president and they wanted to open their home and be a fundraiser, that that’s when they would start cashing their chits and say, “Hey, remember when I helped you with your fundraising effort over there? Can I have you help me over here with mine?” And there’s nothing wrong with that, whatsoever. That’s the way any type of fundraising goes, whether it be philanthropic or political. That’s the way it worked because those were big dollars being asked and given by big people. And you do it, law of big numbers, and those were the biggest fundraisers at the time and a lot of them got the perks of it, being the ambassadors and so forth. Sure. And some of the big fundraisers are brand marquee names, you know, the George Soroses of the world, the Oprahs of the world. A lot of these people are celebrities asking other celebrities for money. Correct. Correct. And you know, that obviously could not be me. I mean, I was super, super excited about Senator Obama at the time. I was one of the first 50 people to get involved in the campaign, months before it was officially announced in early February of 2007. And I just wanted to help. Couldn’t do it full time, didn’t want to do it full time, wanted to still have a job, still have a career, but be able to help where I could. Which was, if I can’t write a big check, and even at the time they couldn’t take them. It was $2,300 max you could individually write. But I could help by being a fundraiser. And by being a fundraiser, it meant not calling all these chits because I didn’t have those. It was, as I had mentioned, just research and get to know my friends. And at the time, I had about 2,000 people that I knew — broadly defined, “knew” — through LinkedIn and Facebook. Again, it’s so many years ago, this was the early stages of social media. And I would just be very, very careful about just understanding and I’d have copious notes, copious pads of paper about who liked what. As I was mentioning earlier, who liked to go to big events or small events or who could write big checks or write only small checks. Who would like to travel for events, who’d like to go to a climate change event or a women’s-only event, at the time. And I just always tried to be very, very careful to put the right ask in front of the right person at the right time. And if you do that, you do that well, then rather than this 0.0001 yield that online does is you get 40 percent yield, 50, 60, 70 percent yield. And obviously, this is a very much an underdog story, but it’s not as if you knew zero people with means in America. Oh, of course. No, I mean, I knew some, but I didn’t know them necessarily in this vein so much. It’s just when you write, when you take an email and you just customize the top line of it and you just recognize that, you know, “Teddy, great seeing you the other day. I know you’re particularly interested in climate change events. Here’s a really good one for you.” All of a sudden, you’re going to read that email, you’re going to recognize that that’s a unique email that was sent to you and there is a higher likelihood, a higher yield potential, from that. Let’s talk about, you were very, very successful. I mean, I think in 2012, I know we’re jumping around a little bit, but 2012 you were top five. So I started, so in 2007, 2008, I was top 10. Give us a sense of, who were some of the other people in your stratosphere? Well, I mean it wouldn’t be a lot of names that people that follow here would necessarily recognize and so forth. But there were a lot of traditional fundraisers in there and I was one of the few first-time people in the top 30. And it was something I was exceedingly proud of. But what the campaign was really excited [about] was the way that we did it: It was the first time that people had used “data” in a way that now would be defined as data analytics. Back then, it certainly wasn’t that classification. And you know, they liked that we got some great press around it and it continued the momentum. In 2012, I took that to a whole new level. In 2012, I was reported as being top three in the country. Got it. And how much did that raise in retrospect? A lot. A lot. Okay. The good thing about this, you can see campaign disclosures, but campaign fundraising is in some ways like venture fundraising. It’s very competitive. There is some ego involved and who’s raised what. Steve has focused more on raising what is now $2,700 chunks. But just for folks who are not aware, there’s a whole world of — which we can get into a bit — so-called soft money, which is super PACs and millions of dollars. And that’s not the world you are involved in. That’s not the world I live in. I liked the hard money, the official, the FEC-reported money, where people are proud to make the contribution and there are limits. There are limits. I like a world of limits. And I would deal with everything from the max of not just the 2,700s but to the committees of the DNCs, the DSCCs, DCCCs, the victory funds and so forth, which would be up to $75,000 in total. But not this stuff that you read about, the hundreds of thousands, certainly millions or even tens of millions of dollars. That’s a world that I have not played in for professional, political and personal reasons. Do you ever step back and reflect on how crazy the last ... I’m sure, you know, you were talking before about how you never really been ... you didn’t grow up seeing yourself as a political animal. But you made it into the top tier of finance folks, basically just through hard work and an innovative idea that, “I’m going to be more strategic about how it’s done.” But also, and I appreciate that, and there is obviously a great amount of truth to that, but it’s also to do it in a way that is putting the donor first. Being respectful. I’ve said that a couple of times. I say that a gazillion times. Respect in fundraising, I can’t say that enough, how important that is, not just for me but for anyone who wants to do it, whether it be for politics or whether it be for nonprofits or academic fundraising. Anything you do, if you can be respectful of the other person, you’re more likely to have a positive outcome and they’ll feel really good about it as well. And then the last thing is that you had mentioned the competitiveness of it. Absolutely. Historically, it had been terribly competitive and in some cases, it still persists. What I’ve always enjoyed is working collaboratively, working in teams, sharing credit, that the whole is greater than the individual parts. And so it’s not just the individual fundraising I did, but you know, I wrote the business plan for Tech for Obama, wrote the business plan for Obama Victory Trustees, wrote the business plan for South Asians for Obama because, you know, obviously the white Jew in me, that’s obvious that I would write that business plan. But those efforts, together, raised many, many, many multiples of what I as an individual could. But you do it so that everyone participates. Everyone gets credit for it. It’s the big tent kind of thing. And that’s where the real value of what I was able to do came in. Because you know, my time, there’s only a certain amount of time I can [put in] as a volunteer fundraiser, there’s only so many people I know. But if you can build initiatives that take hold, that grow roots and that, not just one or five or 10 or 20 people, but 100 or 300 people can participate in and they can make it their own, then you can have this huge, huge, huge multiplier effect and raise that much more money. So let’s finish the story here. So after 2012, you’ve pioneered this new way, you’re still fundraising voluntarily. I’m still doing it manually. Still looking at it manually. This is, and remember, you didn’t grow up dreaming of inventing political fundraising software. Absolutely not. How did this idea for RevUp come about? So one of my closest friends is Ro Khanna, and he had been running for Congress. Obviously, I wanted to help him. I was helping him on the fundraising side, and a lot of opportunity came up where people had been reaching out to me about what I’d been doing for Obama and would that be available, would I help them individually for this race or that race, etc. It’s just one of those things where there’s only one of me and as flattering as it is I don’t like to say no, but I just don’t have enough time to say yes to everyone. What’s your day job at this point? At that time I was helping ... Well, I helped with Obama with the re-elect and I was planning what to do next. Kind of stewing, yeah. Yeah, so I was helping Ro from a campaign perspective, but I was getting ready to either join a tech company out here or start my next thing. Got it. So in that period of time of figuring out what I wanted to do next, I realized what we had done, what we had accomplished for Obama-world had been really unique and really successful. It was something unique that I had done and that there could be an opportunity to help many, many campaigns. So that’s what I wanted to do, so we started doing that. Spoke to the lawyers, made sure that we could do it the way that we wanted to do it because it had never been done before, spoke to both sides of the aisle because the only way you could do what I wanted to do was if it was not a partisan play. Even though I’m a Democrat and I’m a well-known Democrat, from the get-go, since incorporation, we had to treat it like a tech company, which means, just like Google and Twitter and Facebook and Salesforce works with anyone out there that wants to buy the software or leverage the technology, we would have to be the same thing. Which politically is a challenge for me, but professionally and personally, you have to ... I mean you have to do ... Totally. Yeah, right. Yeah, I have a fiduciary responsibility to do what’s best for the company and for investors. The product could thrive if it just had more people using it and testing it and so on and so forth, so Ro was our, he was our prototype client, then we moved to 15 clients for the next year. Then we moved to 50 clients after that. These are clients or campaigns or committees or organizations that are trying to raise money that are in the political sector. This is 2013? No, 2014. 2014, okay. The idea came to me in 2013, but we started building the software in February of 2014. So as I said, Ro was our prototype in that year. Ro is now, he’s been on the podcast before. He’s now the Congressman for Silicon Valley. He is. He loves coming down here. Good. Let’s just show them a little bit more what this is. In the old days, there were professional political fundraisers who probably had something they would call software. What is RevUp and how does it work? I know it’d be easier if you showed me on your phone or computer screens, but verbally, let’s give it a shot. Oh, I can communicate it verbally. For anyone out there listening, imagine you’re someone that ... you’re inspired by a candidate or you’re inspired to help out a nonprofit or someone you know reaches out to you from a campaign or from your university that you went to or nonprofit that you’re supporting, and ropes you into, brings you in to be a fundraiser. The initial use case for the software was as a fundraiser tool for a volunteer, for a “bundler,” as they call them. If you put yourself in that light as everyone’s imagining that, you all have jobs. You all do something else for your life. If you’re gonna do this, this is not something that you have comfort in. It’s outside of your day job. So you’ve committed, you’ve said, “Yes, I’ll help.” And you’re sitting in front of your computer and you have no idea who you should ask, to help. We all know many people, everyone knows hundreds of people, some of us even know thousands of people. Well, what do you do? You have two choices. You can either send out one email about the opportunity that you’re fundraising for, to everyone. That’s not fundraising, that’s spamming your network and hoping that some people respond. But that’s actually what the vast, vast, vast majority of people do. BCC, “Hi, I’m trying to raise a million dollars for candidate X.” Exactly. “Can you give 2,700 bucks?” Or $27. Yeah, right. Or $5. It’s spamming your network. Whatever comes in you’ve raised, so in that case you’re a fundraiser. A lot of times most of it you won’t get and ... That’s a low-dollar approach to high-dollar giving. Right, but anyone that’s doing it, it’s an any-dollar approach. Yeah, an any-dollar approach. It’s the only way that they know how because their time is valuable and they have no information to know any better, to do any better. They’re doing the best that they can with limited information. That’s the whole point. The other way of doing it is that you say, “You know what, an individual ask or an individual email or an email to a small group of people that’s customized is likely to have a higher yield.” But who should I ask? I still know the same thousands of people. So you sit there and you start thinking through your Rolodex or thinking through your mental contact list here, and maybe even you might actually even look through your LinkedIn list and so forth. You’re one by one by one going through this, and as you’re doing it, you’re like, “This is the most unprofessional, inefficient way possible.” And you get frustrated and you push your computer away and you procrastinate. That simple act of procrastination causes that fundraising effort to fail by 50 percent, right there, and every day that you continue to procrastinate, add another 5 percent to the failure rate. Until finally, eventually you’re like, “Oh my god, there’s only six days to the event and I haven’t done much yet. I gotta buckle down and do it.” You start just reaching out to top-of-mind people that come to you, people that you think are individually wealthy, people that you think individually might be interested in this, people that owe you chits, just completely top of mind. As you’re doing it, you’re like, “95 percent of the people I should be reaching out to I’m not reaching out to, and I’m reaching out to a whole bunch of people that I probably shouldn’t be reaching out to. I’m never gonna do this again.” Usually, it fails. So with that in mind we said, “That’s the problem.” No one in business would conduct their work that way, just winging it, sending out one email to every vendor out there and hoping that someone replies or just, without any research, reaching out to people indiscriminately. We would do research. We would try to handle it in a professional, efficient manner. We don’t do that in fundraising. So what the software does is we said ... so it’s data analytics on the fundraising side. It is not the system of record. It’s not the CRM. We don’t compete with any of the companies out there that take the money through their system. You’re not actually raising the money. It’s a way to organize the contacts for raising money. We’re not the links that the money’s going into, and so there are a bunch of different companies out there of all different sizes. Those were all of our partners. We are very, very careful not to do anything like that. What we do is we help the fundraiser, or now we also help — disproportionately, even — the finance staff, the development staff, the advancement office. The tool now has transitioned even more so into a staff-driven set of tools. We’ll talk about what are you guys doing in the future. Yeah. That is ... So now, as a bundler, that same analogy is now with one click you can upload your Gmail, your Outlook, your LinkedIn, your contacts, your iPhone contacts, any Excel spreadsheet CSV list you have. If you know thousands of people, it will merge, purge, de-dupe them, clean them all up, single Rolodex. And then it goes out to thousands of political and charitable databases and it will bring all that data, put it against your contacts, put it against the profile of the organization that you’re raising for, and based on that profile of that organization and all those 10,000 databases, will then force rank every single person you know highest to lowest likelihood to be interested in potentially giving. So at that point it’s like ... Let’s say you’re raising for Ro Khanna’s campaign and you have someone in Palo Alto who is a doctor who’s given money to Democratic Congressional candidates sometimes, not always. Maybe they’re South Asian, and then it matches it up with, okay, Ro Khanna, he’s a new candidate. He’s South Asian, and it matches up and says, “Okay, maybe this person ... they should be in the 75th percentile for the people you call.” Then someone else who has only given to Republicans for their entire life but the last six years they’ve given to every single Democrats, suddenly it’s an easy ask. It’s basically a way of ordering the thousands of people you know into how you should prioritize your time. Right. The part that I’m particularly attracted to is not going back to the same well over and over and over again. That’s a major, major problem in political giving, is that the same people are getting hit up many times every single day. If you can believe this, only 2 percent of the US population gives money to politics. That’s higher than I thought, actually. Most of that money is by .1 of 1 percent. Sure. And so everyone calls the same folks and everyone really, really calls that .1 percent. So yes, this software will certainly have that 2 percent in there and certainly will have the .1 percent in there and it’ll say, have they given before but they haven’t given currently? Have they given less now than they normally give? So go back and ask for more. Have they given to other things like you, but they don’t know you, so maybe if they only knew you, they’d want to give to you? Absolutely, we go, and there’s many different types of filters and parts of the algorithm that will boost people up and boost people down, of people that have historically given. Absolutely. My passion is to go after the other 98 percent, introduce it to people that have never given before. The Ro Khanna example, as you just mentioned. Sure, there are some wonderful donors in the tech and the South Asian community that have given to politics before ... Those are the obvious people. And those have been some of his donors. Those would be like the top-of-mind person. Maybe that person doesn’t even need the software for that person. Exactly. Well no, you always need the software ... You have to be clear, yeah. You always need to know in what order and how fast and what’s the likelihood and what’s the appropriate ask and all that good stuff. Again, you’re trying to be respectful here. But the power of it was to go and identify people who had never written a check, is on no one’s list, but maybe because they’re a South Asian male in tech living in Silicon Valley, maybe rather than a 90 or an 80 or a 70 score, rather than getting a zero score, maybe you get a 43 score. You focus your time and energy around people in the 60s and the 50s and the 40s. People that no one talks to, no one reaches out. Most people don’t even know they exist, but because there are hooks, respectful hooks of potential interests, of attractiveness, of a connection that that campaign or that organization or that university might have with that person, isn’t it a better thing to grow the pie and go after people that nobody goes out to, and there’s a much higher likelihood of them saying yes because there’s no competition for the same dollar? Wouldn’t the pushback be, and I’m sure you’ve heard this before, that part of any human relationship is just the soft touch and the ability to ... Maybe there’s some, oh, you know, they don’t check any of the demographic or historical attributes that would indicate this person’s likely to give, but maybe you’re just really good friends with them and you feel like ... Or maybe you saw them last week at the coffee shop and there was just that human connection that the software can’t predict. How do you deal with that? Look, you should always preference people you know and touch points that are more current and more accurate. So if you know things about people that are outside of software, that trumps anything that any software will give you. So even if it says “this person’s not a giver” and you just have a, maybe just something in your belly that makes you think this person will give, you should still hit them up. Right. They’re not a giver, yet. That’s the whole thing. They haven’t given yet. That’s the part that I find is both the opportunity as well as the challenge, and I like the opportunity part. Let’s talk a little bit about what you’re doing now. You guys just raised $7.5 million. You announced it last week or a couple weeks ago. Yep, about a week ago. By the time this is airing, probably a couple weeks ago. Your background is in politics, this came up as a political idea, but you mentioned development offices, endowments. Just for the grand scheme of things, political fundraising is a very small amount of the fundraising world, overall. Correct. So this is a bid to make the Princeton University development office or a hospital or anybody that’s raising money, you’re now pitching this as a software for anybody who has to cull a database and figure out who to call. Exactly. So if you think about giving last year and fundraising in the United States, it went up to, it crossed $400 billion that this country was generous to open up their wallets and give. Of that, only 7 billion, in total, over two years in this cycle goes to politics. People act like ... that’s always the common criticism of campaign finance reformers, who say there’s so much money in politics, and I think it’s Mitch McConnell or maybe John Boehner who has this quote about more money being spent on toothpaste than on politics. Exactly. That is, unfortunately, true. The reason why that feels the way it is is that so much money is used on broadcast television because it’s still exceedingly effective to getting out the message, so everyone sees it. So they see more money, more ads, and you just get oversaturated with ads. The other reason why is that a very, very small percent of the population is just getting hit up so much and they’re very, very vocal about that, as they should be. So that’s why you’re getting that view. So the much larger market, by so many orders of magnitude, are nonprofits at large, and especially as you mentioned, higher ed and healthcare as very large components within that. That is what we’re doing with the software. We’ve had a very successful couple years coming out with first our prototype, our alpha, our beta, coming out of self mode a couple years ago growing. We now serve nearly about 300 campaigns and committees and so forth. We’ll continue to grow that. Next year will be super-exciting given that it will be a presidential cycle and so many races as well there, but we did do the financing to very specifically go into the larger markets and do what we do in data analytics, working with the CRMs, with them as partners, but now go into these larger categories and do exactly what we’ve done in politics into these larger categories, because they’re chomping at the bit for next-generation type of tools. These are pretty, not stodgy institutions but these are, they have the formal development offices. These are ... Is there any party that worries about just some of the skills not translating or some of the software not translating? I mean, look. Everyone does it in their own way. There’s certainly best practices of how a lot of these organizations do it, and these are very, very professional people. The larger the organization, the more people they have and the more structured they tend to be. As a result, the more professional they can be. They have more staff, they can have more tools, they can have more training, etc. But there are half a million nonprofits. Everyone’s raising. It just depends on how much resources you have at your disposal, and so we just want to be a tool to complement what they’re currently using. I know a lot of these guys are using, whether it be Raiser’s Edge or Blackbaud or they’re working with Salesforce and probably a hundred other companies out there as a system of record to be able to help them on the data analytics side for both staff as well as volunteers to have the same level of effect in those verticals as I’m honored to say that we’ve had success this last few years. We’ve been just blessed with all the awards in the industry that we’ve won. We won best fundraising technology, most innovative product of the year two years in a row, best startup, best analytics. We deployed our mobile app last year. We won the award for best mobile app. What we’re doing as a data analytics company has not been done before in these three verticals, and what I’m super proud of, where I’ve lived for the past two decades, is to be a Silicon Valley company bringing Silicon Valley tech to these three verticals that have historically not had the opportunity to benefit from that, at least from a data analytics perspective. It’s well known on the internet that you’re a Democrat. But this is the software where you’re definitely using, there’s some prominent Republican clients out there. Describe how much you do politically, personally, these days? Yeah. I’ve had to cut back in many cases, which is very, very hard for me on a personal level because that’s my genesis in all this. But for instance, we’ll be very involved in the presidential races next year. I won’t, as an individual, be able to participate because how can I be personally helping one when I’m working with 5, 10, 15, 20 people that may or may not be running? Sure. On a personal level I’ve had to do some cutting back. I mean, I still help this candidate over here or this candidate over there. Obviously you’re still involved with Ro Khanna. I’m still helping Ro. There’s this guy, Sri Kulkarni in Houston, Texas, who is a very, very exciting candidate, that is basically the Ro equivalent on the foreign policy side. He’s 14 years State Department, and a bunch of different very, very challenging environments, placements he’s been over the years. He speaks six languages fluently. A very exciting candidate there that’s running in a Houston district. I’ve been helping them as well. I still help a number of candidates here or there. But, where I really, really dug in and was National Finance Committee and chairman of this, or co-chairman of that, and so forth, I probably won’t be able to do. Give up those fancy titles. How can you do that when you’re helping them from a professional purposes? That’s the whole point, which is that’s how I can work with Republicans as well as Democrats. That’s how I can work with multiple Democrats in the same race. Because they can all use the software. Right. Here we are in the state of California and on the Dems side there’ll be races where there were four, five, six candidates in the same race for a Congressional district that we just experienced for the last year and a half here. In June, most of those, all but one or two will lose. But we were able to help with multiples of them because we’re just a tech company. So, if you pick exclusives then you’re trying to pick horses. You’re not really a tech company whatsoever. And then you’re part of the advocacy apparatus. Yeah. You can’t build a ... You’re trying to be a Google or Facebook software platform that folks can use or not use. That’s independent, though, from, “Hi, I’m Steve Spinner, I was on the Obama Finance Committee.” Exactly, exactly. That’s the only way that people trust you that you’re gonna treat them the same as the other people because you treat everyone the same. We try our best from a customer service or partner success perspective you treat everyone exactly the same. People that know that we have multiple clients in the same sector, it’s never been an issue in four years. People that know that we sometimes have clients on the opposite side of the aisle, it’s never been an issue in four years. Where I take that as one of the things I’m honestly most proud of is because I’m a proud Dem. I’m a card-carrying, scar-ridden Dem, that I can meet with Republicans. I mean, where did I meet you, Teddy, originally? I met you ... I think it was the Mitt Romney E2 Conference. Exactly. Which I was covering when I was at at CNN. I want to talk about how fundraising has changed a little bit over time. You start in 2005, this is pre-Citizens United. This is one of the key Supreme Court decisions that created super PACs. I think there’s been a lot of discussion in the media. People in my industry used to cover political money about, has Trump changed the game at all with fundraising? I’m just curious. We’re coming up on the 2020 cycle, is fundraising different than it was a decade ago? It’s much larger. Sure. I mean it’s much, much larger. It’s much more successful online than it’s been. Every four years, you get this new bar that it crosses, and you don’t think it can get any more successful than that. And of course, four years later it’s twice as much as it was before. So yeah, it continues to evolve. There’s still a long, long ways to go. There is a certain amount of marrying of spray and pray. Blind fundraising just increased the size of the list and you don’t care about the terms. Right. This is online, low dollar. Yeah. You’re on the Beto O’Rourke email list. That’s a whole nother industry. That’s not your industry. It’s not me at all. Yeah. I can’t stand it. Yeah. But, it’s the opposite of the respect part that I talk about. Yeah. How many hundreds of fundraising emails do we all get every day? We delete 99 percent of them. Yeah. That I can’t stand. They also have lots of screaming headlines like, “The country’s in crisis!” That’s actually one of the things that’s helped worsen the narrative in politics. It’s on both sides. Pox on everyone. Yeah. The big changes that have happened — and there are many people that would say this and I’m not the only one — is Democrats historically always had a huge, huge advantage with small-dollar online donating. That started with Howard Dean in 2004 and it’s only picked up, ever since. For the first time ever in the last couple of years the Republicans with Donald Trump was able to do a certain amount of that and do it quite effectively in 2015, especially in 2016. That’s persisted through this cycle, through the fundraising that they’ve done on the RNC side. But outside of that, one anomaly there on the Republican side, there’s still a huge difference, a huge competitive advantage of small dollar on the Democrat side than on the Republican side. The other thing is that Democrats have ActBlue, which really is a ... It’s like a portal. Do you want to describe it? It is. It’s just a way to easily be able to make multiple donations over time, stores all your information, makes recommendations and so forth. It’s just been very, very successful for Democrats. They have a company called NGP VAN, which is one of our partners. That’s also very, very good at being the system of record. And so, the technology has always been, historically, an advantage on the Dems side, especially as it deals with small dollars. On the big dollars, and especially on the soft-money dollars, Republicans have historically always had a lead on that, especially obviously ever since Citizens United. Yeah, I just want to explain it for folks. I mean, so basically, the way that lots of campaign dollars were raised today, and the only way they were really raised pre-Citizens United was, there’s a federal limit for how much a donor can give to a campaign, or a committee. And after Citizens United, they created the creation of super PACs. Pools of cash where people can cut checks of unlimited size. That’s what a lot of the headline-grabbing stories are. Peter Thiel giving a million dollars to Club for Growth, or Sheldon Adelson giving 25 million dollars to a party-sponsored Senate super PAC. That’s what people think of when they read a campaign finance story, but then there’s also just the ... I mean $2700 is not nothing obviously, but it’s not 25 from Sheldon Adelson. Right. You have the super PAC where you can write unlimited and it’s disclosed. Correct. There’s also write-unlimited and it’s still not disclosed and that’s what they call “dark money.” Thankfully, that’s decreased, but that’s just still something I’m very, very uncomfortable with, and many, many people are very, very uncomfortable with because of lack of disclosure. Right. I mean, there’s some Democrats that are more and more comfortable with... This is epitomized by Charles and David Koch who created a large of organizations that are 501C4s, so they get some sort of tax exemptions in exchange for being theoretically non-advocacy organizations. Right. But the thing is, I’m always very protective and defensive of donors when they give hard money up to the max. And when I say that, “protective,” meaning that they’re allowed to do it. And if they want to do it once that’s great, if they want to do it 2500, times they should be allowed to do that. They shouldn’t be hit for donating. I always have a problem when donors get hit because they support when they get criticized. This is all public information. It’s all public information. They’re required to, but they’re doing what they’re allowed to do because they’re inspired to do that. There’s something about that candidate that they like a lot. They can’t necessarily give time. They can’t necessarily travel for them, but they can write $250. They can write maybe $2700. They shouldn’t become part of an attack ad, and some people do that. To be fair, this is on both sides, right? I mean there are ... Well, no. It’s usually on the Republican side to Democrats historically. But where it’s really gotten bad is on the larger checks, the soft money. Where now those guys are writing the large checks and they’re getting hit. In many cases they deserve to get hit for that. I like to protect up to the max, the $2700, and then beyond that, it’s discretionary on the donor. This did change with Harry Reid… Charles and David Koch, for instance, did not used to be household names. They’re obviously extremely wealthy. But, this became a big deal with Harry Reid, who went out there and attacked the Kochs during the 2012 campaign- Correct. ... by name, I think, on the Senate floor. That’s on the soft money. Yeah. On the big seven, eight, nine figures. Sure. I’m always very, very protective of when they- Someone expressing their democratic right to give $2,700 bucks. Or $250. Yeah. I actually saw a Dem-on-Dem hit piece last week right here in the Bay Area. Two Democrats, an assembly race, and I saw someone doing an online posting there where they were just were hitting people for writing $250, or $500, or $1,000 because they were supporting the other candidate. That really upsets me. Yeah, I think it’s $200, right? Beyond that, that’s when you start getting named in campaign finance reforms. Above $200, yes. Right, okay. You have to disclose. For folks out there, yeah, if you give more than $200 you will be findable by people like me, and I guess people like Steven, and other folks as well. Trump, I mean this is mostly on the Republican side, there’s an argument to be made. I wrote a lot of stories about Trump’s fundraising woes. During 2016, there was a lot of Republican donors like the folks at the Romney Summit we were just talking about who felt Trump is running against the system, draining the swamp. I think it’s led to at least some budding conventional wisdom that political fundraising doesn’t matter anymore. Trump can just hog the airways. The whole point of raising money, presumably, is to buy media attention. To what extent do you think he has actually changed how political fundraising could be done at least? I mean, this is a much longer conversation than the last few minutes of this. He’s definitely changed some aspects of it absolutely. But I do not believe that in the next cycle for the re-elect if he is the candidate on the Republican side, that the media will do in that race, even as a sitting president, what they did in the last one because it was comedy. In terms of campaign coverage. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it was Trump 24 hours a day on all networks, not just on the Foxes, but he was also on MSNBC all the time. Sure. As a sitting president, they’re even now starting to cut back. There’s been a lot of news about that over the last month, month and a half that one of the reasons why- The rallies aren’t getting live anymore. Well, one of the reasons why the president’s going out so much is because a lot of his comments are not getting covered as much, and the rallies, even those are not getting covered as much. And so, he’s trying to say things that are newsworthy, or he’s trying to make them newsworthy to force him to get coverage like what he did last night in Montana because people are trying to cut back on that because they realize it is an unfair advantage. I mean he won disproportionately ... Well, there were many reasons why Trump won last cycle, but one of them was that he just had so much earned media that he didn’t have to pay a penny for, and 10 times more than his closest competitor, and 100 times more than some of his other competitors. So you don’t feel like that was a moment in time, that Trump was — maybe there was a media fascination with him? He obviously also self-funded somewhat. He self-funded his Republican primary race almost entirely. He gave some money, not as much as he promised to give during the general to his campaign. But, at least in the primary, right, I mean, he was outspent. That was the whole point. He loved to make fun of Jeb Bush, right? Right. But that’s how he was able to make up for the shortfalls. Right. He did fund himself to the level that he need to get in the game. Yeah. And have a team that he needed. But he was able to more than make up for it with his comments that caused him to get all this extra media. He starts out as having higher name ID than almost anyone else on the stage. Yeah. And so, when you start out with just by your name ID from TV, from “The Apprentice,” being able to have 15, 17, 18 percent support, and name ID of 35, 45, maybe even up to 60 percent name ID, how is anyone else supposed to be able to compete with that? Yeah. You see that as not necessarily that consequential for the way that your business of political fundraising has done? No, not for me. I mean you still have to fund your campaigns. The part that actually gets me excited from a RevUp perspective is, historically money is the number one, and the only one that matters in, do you make a decision to run for office, or not? Can I raise the money? And if you believe you can raise the money, then you raise your hand, and you run for office. I actually hate that. I believe that money should not be the reason why you decide to run for office. It should just be part of the execution plan. You should run for office because you think you can do a better job, that you can help people, and you can move us in a positive direction. What RevUp can do in politics, and what RevUp can especially do for non-profits and universities is lower the bar for you to more easily be able to raise the amount of money you need, if you’re a candidate, to run a competitive race. Right. Do you agree in general with the idea that money is necessary but not sufficient for competitiveness? Yes, yes. You don’t need to have the same amount. You absolutely don’t need to have the same amount. Well, there’s a minimum threshold for ... Beto O’Rourke doesn’t need to have $38 million in a month to be a competitive candidate. He might lose. Absolutely, but yeah, absolutely, or you can have races where you’re raising 28 million dollars and you lose like crazy to someone who you’ve raised three, four times more money. You can have other races where you raised one million dollars and it’s one-fourth the amount of money as the other person and you win handily. Yeah. But you have to raise a certain amount to get in the game. You have to raise to be able to have a team and to be able to get your message out. There are other things that matter, absolutely. That’s why it’s called a campaign. There are many facets of it, but money gets you in the game. That’s what RevUp is focused on in politics, is to lower the bar to make it easier for you to raise the minimum that you need to be able to run a competitive race. The same thing, fulfill the entire mission and charter for a nonprofit and a university. Right. It doesn’t mean you’ll win, but at least you can kind of play the game. Exactly. Steve, fascinating conversation, and thanks for coming on the show.

The exec who built Snapchat Discover is leaving the company," Nick Bell is stepping down following some recent management changes and four-plus tumultuous years. Nick Bell, Snap’s VP of content and the guy who built Snapchat’s Discover section, is leaving the company. Bell, who has worked at Snap for more than four years, announced his departure internally on Monday morning. “After nearly 5 years and a once in a lifetime ride, I have let Evan know that I am leaving Snap to take some time off to recharge before deciding on my next adventure,” he said in an email to colleagues. Cheddar first broke the news. Bell was responsible for all of Snap’s content and partnerships, which included deals for original video and stories that appear in Snapchat’s Discover section. Snap has a number of deals in place with high-profile publishers like ESPN, the Daily Mail, NBC and the NFL, and is also working on a slate of new original shows exclusive to Snapchat. Discover certainly has its flaws — a lot of the content has felt very racy and tabloid-y in recent years — but Snapchat and some publishers still make money from the deals. Bell was on the Recode Media podcast last month, and we asked if he was planning to stick around for a while. “I will be at Snap as long as I feel super excited about the company and as long as I feel super excited about what I’m doing day to day,” he said. “And right now, you know, we’ve talked about some of that stuff today. Right now I’m having a blast and I’m excited about this stuff we’re launching towards the end of this year.” Of course, that’s the kind of thing people say when they aren’t ready to announce that they’re leaving their job. But it still creates some awkward questions. Is he no longer “super excited” about what Snap is doing on the content side? If not, why not? And what happened in the past month to change that? There is one theory. In his four-plus years at Snap, Bell has reported to CEO Evan Spiegel. But Snap just brought in two new executives to replace the recently departed Imran Khan, Spiegel’s No. 2. One of those execs, Jared Grusd, is Snap’s new chief strategy officer overseeing all partnerships and content. Bell was likely going to report to Grusd, not Spiegel, moving forward. On the other hand, discussions that Bell might be leaving had been going around the media industry for months. He was heavily involved in bringing Grusd to Snapchat, according to a source, so it’s possible that Grusd was always intended to be Bell’s replacement. Why they couldn’t just say that when Grusd joined, I don’t know. Either way, Bell leaves at a time of transition for Snap’s executive team, and there’s no denying that he lived through four-plus roller-coaster years at the company. “We are so grateful for Nick and everything he has built at Snap,” Spiegel said in a statement provided to Recode. “It has been an incredible journey that began with our vision for what content could be on mobile. Today, more people are watching more premium content on Snap than ever before, and we couldn’t be more excited about the momentum we are seeing with Snap Originals. We will miss Nick, and we wish him all the best.” ",https://www.recode.net/2018/11/12/18088412/nick-bell-snap-departs-discover,0,recode,python,NULL,2018-11-12
"Amazon is dominant online, but local retail still has advantages Jeff Bezos can’t replicate"," Sometimes it’s worth putting on your shoes and taking a walk. The retail battle with Amazon is everywhere, but for me it is raging on 14th Street NW in Washington, D.C. It is here that I have found only three single pockets of resistance to the online retail giant, which is marching its way into everything and at everyone these days. And, even more so here since it seems that one of the much-hyped new headquarters of Amazon will also be near, just a few miles across the Potomac River in Crystal City. But, first, let me set it up: 14th Street NW is a major thoroughfare cutting through the Logan Circle-Shaw neighborhoods right near a small house I just bought recently due to my frequent visits. The area has undergone a major gentrification since I last lived in D.C. in the 1990s and now it is replete with new condos, trendy restaurants and bars. And, of course, hip stores, both chain and local, all to serve the scads of millennials who roam the sidewalks in search of whatever. Given I am much older and not often in the market for anything — my more frantic hunting and gathering was over way back when — it’s the first time in a long while that I have had to outfit another home. More to the point, it’s the first time I have had to do so in the digital era — or, more precisely, in the Age of Amazon. And while that sounds like a rather grand way to put it, what has become very clear to me is that the ability of anyone in retail to fend off the online — and increasingly offline — retail behemoth is moving toward nil. I say this as a personal consumer this time and not as someone with a lot of knowledge about the changing mechanics of retail and the growth of Amazon. That I do possess, having been a retail reporter for the Washington Post for many years pre-Amazon and later having covered its CEO and founder Jeff Bezos from his earliest days when he had a tiny startup in a sketchy neighborhood of Seattle. At that time, Jeff was very accessible and, dare I say, saucy in both his ambitions and energy. He only ran the “earth’s biggest bookstore” – a grandiose claim that irked many then, even if it would prove to be true soon enough. And not just for books, but in selling just about everything, first for other retailers and consumer goods makers and, more often now, sourced by the company itself. That is a story we all know by now, as Amazon has barreled ever forward like a giant Borg, a term I also use for Google, the Borg of Information, and Facebook, the Borg of Social Media. And, indeed, resistance is becoming futile to all of them, although perhaps most of all to Amazon. It’s not about the typical retail advantage of market power (there is plenty of retail around) or price (there are lower-priced options), but about a nearly flawless and almost unholy combination of many other factors the company has sharpened to a fine edge that is now slicing through everything. Including my will to resist, as it has turned out these days. This has been a sudden shift too, since my use of Amazon has been consistent for years, but not excessive. I am a Prime member, but I mostly order various commodity items like phone cords and weird things I don’t want to spend a lot of time finding analog like an unusual miso paste. But, mostly, I try my best to go to stores, especially local ones. I do it both to support the community and a vibrant street life and because I think of a really good retail experience as something more than a soul-sapping transactional thing. But my recent experience has blown me away since Amazon has now managed to create a series of something I can only describe as moats to lock me in more and more and also keep out other retail options. Among these moats: Convenience, data, speed, breadth and flat-out excellent customer service. Other retailers are not even close. For example, I ordered a bed frame for my 16-year-old son from CB2, after trudging to its store in Georgetown to take a look at it. That was worthwhile enough, since it is always good to see such an item. But it took a really long time to fill out the order form by the associate, after which I got the news that it would take two weeks to arrive and cost me $75 in cash for that privilege. And when it finally came? It turned out to be the wrong frame and had to go back on the truck, after which it took me several annoying tweets and many calls to get a refund. So what did I do that very day? I looked on Amazon’s Prime Now service and had a similar enough frame at my home in two hours at about half the price and with no extra shipping charge. The same thing happened over and over when I tried to shop in person, whether it was a shelf for clothes or an iron or a small table. And it was worse, especially if it was at a big-box store like Target, which was so hopelessly large and confusing that I gave up and left the cart right there and ordered it all on Amazon — a coffee machine, a toaster oven, a comforter, some sheets — from the parking lot. It was mostly at my house by nightfall, without one single error. My issue was only this: I never spoke to or interacted with anyone who was sentient in this whole experience, which is what made the difference at only three physical stores that got my business time and again. And more, with each pushing a different reason for making me want to give them my money. Home Rule The storefront window at Home Rule Here’s why: Creativity: One was a small shop called Home Rule, which sells all kinds of home goods. It’s a colorful place with its walls covered with all kinds of objects that reflect the impeccable taste and whimsy of the retailer. While many of the items there were certainly on Amazon, I would have spent a dog’s age not finding them and so many in one place. In the old days, this was called merchandising, but I consider it basic creativity. From the retro green alarm clock to the weird mini ladles to the odd magnetized flatware to a bright blue spatula to scrape out jars, it was a delight to shop there, something no algorithm will ever replace. It’s true that everything that can be digitized will be digitized, but you still cannot digitize creativity. Flickr Logan Hardware Perfectly human customer service: Across the street from Home Rule is an old-style hardware store called Logan Hardware, which is in the Ace Hardware chain. Here’s what happens when you enter the also-jam-packed store: A real person with knowledge of the whole place asks you if they can help you. And if they don’t know, they find out immediately and then get you to a better person. This is simply key since every single thing in Logan Hardware is easy to find on Amazon and can be gotten with a click. In addition, there is a homey comfort with all this kind of service, from the key-maker in the back to the garden guy upstairs to the clerk who lets you know that they also have these weird local pretzels over there you might want to try because they are delicious. And they are delicious, which — again — a computer cannot tell you with any certainty. Unique and quirky and nowhere else: The last stand against Amazon is perhaps the hardest to pull off, but it happens daily at a large antique furniture store called Miss Pixie’s, just down the street from the other two. Miss Pixie’s The front window at Miss Pixie’s When I think about what is great about retail — delightful, overflowing, endlessly discoverable and impossible to copy — this is it. By going to auctions and constantly replenishing the stock of everything from glasses to trays to large cabinets to whatever — with a clear eye to this-is-it-and-it-is-cool — Miss Pixie’s cannot be breached by any robotic technique. It is where I missed buying a loveseat glider that reminded me of so many summer nights with my grandmother, because I hesitated and then it was gone forever. But it was also there that I found more worn Fiestaware plates to match those I had lost and a weathered-by-real-use wrought iron outdoor table and an out-of-date globe for my 13-year-old. “Look, Mom,” he said, spinning it around madly to point out all the old countries there that had shifted to new countries now. “So much has changed.” He has no idea.

Recode Daily: Inside the hype and reality of the voice technology ‘revolution’," Plus: Amazon is selling Apple devices again; meet Google’s hardware design guru; here come the nanoinfluencers; tarot for tech optimists. Voice interfaces like Alexa and Siri have been adopted faster than almost any other technology in history — even surpassing the smartphone in their four-year trajectory. Approximately one-quarter to one-third of the U.S. population already owns a smart speaker like the Echo or Google Home; the global number of installed smart speakers is going to more than double to 225 million units in two years. But to be revolutionary, they will need to find a greater calling — a new, breakout application. Here’s an in-depth look at where voice tech is succeeding (music, radio, podcasts), where it’s not (shopping) and who the winners will be. [Rani Molla / Recode] [Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox? Subscribe here.] Amazon is now selling Apple’s latest devices on its website — including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, Apple Watches and Apple TVs, but not the Amazon Echo competitor, HomePod. Amazon previously stopped selling the Apple TV media-streaming device on its site in 2015 because it wasn’t compatible with its own video service; it previously only sold older iPhone models. [Mark Gurman and Spencer Soper / Bloomberg] Google is trying to define a recognizable in-house hardware identity, something that’s hugely important as the company tries to move beyond search, software, advertising and artificial intelligence to compete with such hardware stalwarts as Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Meet Vice President of Design Ivy Ross, a former jewelry designer who added the mint-green power button to the Pixel smartphone, turned your Google speakers into river pebbles and signs off on every Google hardware product before it hits the shelves. [Katia Moskvitch / Wired UK] German database giant SAP is buying Utah-based startup Qualtrics for $8 billion in cash. Qualtrics, which specializes in “experience management,” or XM, provides tools to help companies gather feedback and optimize their products; it was scheduled to hold its much-anticipated IPO this week, which could have valued the company at more than $5 billion right out of the gate. Founded by CEO Ryan Smith with brother Jared and father Scott, Qualtrics is known for not accepting any venture funding until it had been in business for a decade. [Matt Weinberger / Business Insider] Alibaba sold more than $30 billion worth of goods during its 24-hour self-created shopping holiday called Singles Day; the 10th edition of the sales festival easily topped last year’s sales of $25.3 billion. Here’s how the Chinese retail giant turned the celebration of singledom — it’s always on Nov. 11, or 11/11, a date chosen for its likeness to “bare sticks,” which is Chinese slang for bachelors —into a sales event bigger than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. In 2009, Alibaba started promoting the day as an opportunity for consumers to splurge on gifts to themselves, offering steep discounts through its consumer shopping site for branded goods, Tmall. [Eamon Barrett / Fortune] The previous story was from Fortune magazine, which was just purchased for $150 million in cash by Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon — the storied business publication’s second new owner this year. The 88-year-old magazine, which first published months after the 1929 stock-market crash, continues to carry weight with business elites, reflected in the attention paid to rankings such as the Fortune 500, special issues like “World’s Most Admired Companies” and cover profiles of prominent chief executives.[Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg / The Wall Street Journal] First there were the influencers, and then the microinfluencers. Now meet the nanoinfluencers — people who have as few as a thousand followers, are good at social and are willing to advertise products. Their relative lack of fame is one of the qualities that makes them approachable by companies; when they recommend a shampoo or a lotion or a furniture brand on Instagram, their word seems as genuine as advice from a friend. Brands enjoy working with nanoinfluencers partly because they are easy to deal with. In exchange for free products or a small commission, nanos typically say whatever companies tell them to.
